To evaluate errors associated with using different deformable image registration (DIR) pathways to deform dose from planning CT (pCT) to cone-beam CT (CBCT).


METHODS
Deforming dose is controversial because of the lack of quality assurance tools. We previously proposed a novel metric to evaluate dose deformation error (DDE) by warping dose information using two methods, via dose and contour deformation. First, isodose lines of the pCT were converted into structures and then deformed to the CBCT using an image based deformation map (dose/structure/deform). Alternatively, the dose matrix from the pCT was deformed to CBCT using the same deformation map, and then the same isodose lines of the deformed dose were converted into structures (dose/deform/structure). The doses corresponding to each structure were queried from the deformed dose and full-width-half-maximums were used to evaluate the dose dispersion. The difference between the FWHM of each isodose level structure is defined as the DDE. Three head-and-neck cancer patients were identified. For each patient, two DIRs were performed between the pCT and CBCT, either deforming pCT-to-CBCT or CBCT-to-pCT. We evaluated the errors associated by using either of these pathways to deform dose. A commercially available, Demons based DIR was used for this study, and 10 isodose levels (20% to 105%) were used to evaluate the errors in various dose levels.


RESULTS
The prescription dose for all patients was 70 Gy. The mean DDE for CT-to-CBCT deformation was 1.0 Gy (range: 0.3-2.0 Gy) and this was increased to 4.3 Gy (range: 1.5-6.4 Gy) for CBCT-to-CT deformation. The mean increase in DDE between the two deformations was 3.3 Gy (range: 1.0-5.4 Gy).


CONCLUSION
The proposed DDF was used to quantitatively estimate dose deformation errors caused by different pathways to perform DIR. Deforming dose using CBCT-to-CT deformation produced greater error than CT-to-CBCT deformation.",1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01f8f8e7fdcd298e0c77f7f7053747c7857a4248

assessment of brain development at this critical stage. Deep learning methods
represent the state of the art in medical image segmentation and have also
achieved impressive results in brain segmentation. However, effective training
of a deep learning model to perform this task requires a large number of
training images to represent the rapid development of the transient fetal brain
structures. On the other hand, manual multi-label segmentation of a large
number of 3D images is prohibitive. To address this challenge, we segmented 272
training images, covering 19-39 gestational weeks, using an automatic
multi-atlas segmentation strategy based on deformable registration and
probabilistic atlas fusion, and manually corrected large errors in those
segmentations. Since this process generated a large training dataset with noisy
segmentations, we developed a novel label smoothing procedure and a loss
function to train a deep learning model with smoothed noisy segmentations. Our
proposed methods properly account for the uncertainty in tissue boundaries. We
evaluated our method on 23 manually-segmented test images of a separate set of
fetuses. Results show that our method achieves an average Dice similarity
coefficient of 0.893 and 0.916 for the transient structures of younger and
older fetuses, respectively. Our method generated results that were
significantly more accurate than several state-of-the-art methods including
nnU-Net that achieved the closest results to our method. Our trained model can
serve as a valuable tool to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of fetal
brain analysis in MRI",2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14962

We perform several experiments in which we remove ground-truth minutiae from latent fingerprints and evaluate the effects on matching score and rank-n identification using two different matchers and the popular NIST SD27 dataset. We observe how missing even one minutia from a fingerprint can have a significant negative impact on the identification performance. Our experimental results show that a fingerprint which has a top rank can be demoted to a bottom rank when two or more minutiae are missed. From our experimental results, we have noticed that some minutiae are more critical than others to correctly identify a latent fingerprint. Based on this finding, we have created a dataset to train several machine learning models trying to predict the impact of each minutia in the matching score of a fingerprint identification system.

Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements.

Tumor shrinkage and modification of patient anatomy may occur within the weeks of therapy. Dose warping algorithm and IGRT can usefully determinate morphological variations occurring during treatments and predict possible challenge or requirement of re-planning. Using metaanalysis and developing Predictive Neural Network (PNN) is possible to collect information for perspective treatment evaluation of inappropriate dose delivery or to re-planning care course.


METHODS
23 H' N patients, treated using Tomotherapy Unit, were post-processed using deformable hybrid algorithms to generate contours evolution throughout the course. 750 MVCT were elaborated focusing on parotids. For each deformable image registration were generated deformable ROIs and re-mapped to dose grid to accumulate dose. A nomogram was developed to evaluate Volume (V) and Dose (D) variations. Using Moving Average (MA) function and PNN were identified the weeks when re-plan should be predictable.


RESULTS
The weekly nomogram provided the percentage of patients affected by V and D deviation respect to the first day of treatment. During 1st week of treatment 95% of patients have a ΔV=10% and ΔD=2%. In the 6th week, only 70% of cases remain inside that range. The PNN using Cluster Analysis and Support Vector Machines, highlighted the requirement of warping methods in clinical practice. Validated by 8 patients test cases, PNN allow to classify 2 statistical cluster related to original plan and re-plan requirements. MA with period of 3 and 5 days, predict days of treatment where to locate physics replan. Best statistical benefits can be achieved with evaluation in the 4th week.


CONCLUSION
Body morphing and organ motion during therapy can affect to the dose distribution and induce unexpected or late toxicities. Hybrid deformable registration allows to study the time to re-plan or to adapt treatments.

This study investigated the cortical regions involved in hardness perception modulated by visual information using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). Twenty-two healthy participants were enrolled. They were required to place their left and right hands at the front and back, respectively, of a mirror attached to a platform placed above them while lying in a magnetic resonance scanner. In conditions SFT, MED, and HRD, one of three polyurethane foam pads of varying hardness (soft, medium, and hard, respectively) was presented to the left hand in a given trial, while only the medium pad was presented to the right hand in all trials. MED was defined as the control condition, because the visual and haptic information was congruent. During the scan, the participants were required to push the pad with the both hands while observing the reflection of the left hand and estimate the hardness of the pad perceived by the right (hidden) hand based on magnitude estimation. Behavioral results showed that the perceived hardness was significantly biased toward softer or harder in >73% of the trials in conditions SFT and HRD; we designated these trials as visually modulated (SFTvm and HRDvm, respectively). The accuracy map was calculated individually for each of the pair-wise comparisons of (SFTvm vs. MED), (HRDvm vs. MED), and (SFTvm vs. HRDvm) by a searchlight MVPA, and the cortical regions encoding the perceived hardness with visual modulation were identified by conjunction of the three accuracy maps in group analysis. The cluster was observed in the right sensory motor cortex, left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), bilateral parietal operculum (PO), and occipito-temporal cortex (OTC). Together with previous findings on such cortical regions, we conclude that the visual information of finger movements processed in the OTC may be integrated with haptic input in the left aIPS, and the subjective hardness perceived by the right hand with visual modulation may be processed in the cortical network between the left PO and aIPS",19,https://core.ac.uk/download/343492801.pdf

Anthropometric data are of paramount importance in several applications, including fashion design, medical diagnosis, and virtual character modeling, all of which require a fully automatic anthropometric measurement extraction method. 3-D-based methods for anthropometric measurement extraction becomes more and more popular due to their improved accuracy compared to classical image-based approaches. Existing 3-D methods can be mainly classified into two categories: landmark and template-based methods. The former is highly dependent on the estimated landmarks which are highly sensitive to noise in the input or missing data. The latter has to iteratively solve an objective function to deform a body template to fit the scan, which is time-consuming while being also sensitive to noise and missing data. In this study, we propose the first approach for automatic contact-less anthropometric measurements extraction based on deep-learning (AM-DL). A novel module dubbed multiscale EdgeConv is proposed to learn local features from point clouds at multiple scales. Multiscale EdgeConv can be directly integrated with other neural networks for various tasks, e.g., classification of point clouds. We exploit this module to design an encoder–decoder architecture that learns to deform a template model to fit a given scan. The measurement values are then calculated on the deformed template model. To evaluate the proposed method, 27 female and 25 male subjects were scanned using a photogrametry-based scanner and measured by an experienced tailor. Experimental results on the synthetic ModelNet40 dataset and on the real scans demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and performs sufficiently close to a professional tailor.",21,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d7631e93d285302f02bfa819bbc6061a60d8e60
"Mendoza Bobadilla, Julio Cesar, 1990-",Classificação de nódulos pulmonares baseada em redes neurais convolucionais profundas em radiografias,2018-09-03 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,,"Orientador: Hélio PedriniDissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Instituto de ComputaçãoResumo: O câncer de pulmão, que se caracteriza pela presença de nódulos, é o tipo mais comum de câncer em todo o mundo, além de ser um dos mais agressivos e fatais, com 20% da mortalidade total por câncer. A triagem do câncer de pulmão pode ser realizada por radiologistas que analisam imagens de raios-X de tórax (CXR). No entanto, a detecção de nódulos pulmonares é uma tarefa difícil devido a sua grande variabilidade, limitações humanas de memória, distração e fadiga, entre outros fatores. Essas dificuldades motivam o desenvolvimento de sistemas de diagnóstico por computador (CAD) para apoiar radiologistas na detecção de nódulos pulmonares. A classificação do nódulo do pulmão é um dos principais tópicos relacionados aos sistemas de CAD. Embora as redes neurais convolucionais (CNN) tenham demonstrado um bom desempenho em muitas tarefas, há poucas explorações de seu uso para classificar nódulos pulmonares em imagens CXR. Neste trabalho, propusemos e analisamos um arcabouço para a detecção de nódulos pulmonares em imagens de CXR que inclui segmentação da área pulmonar, localização de nódulos e classificação de nódulos candidatos. Apresentamos um método para classificação de nódulos candidatos com CNNs treinadas a partir do zero. A eficácia do nosso método baseia-se na seleção de parâmetros de aumento de dados, no projeto de uma arquitetura CNN especializada, no uso da regularização de dropout na rede, inclusive em camadas convolucionais, e no tratamento da falta de amostras de nódulos em comparação com amostras de fundo, balanceando mini-lotes em cada iteração da descida do gradiente estocástico. Todas as decisões de seleção do modelo foram tomadas usando-se um subconjunto de imagens CXR da base Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC/IDRI) separadamente. Então, utilizamos todas as imagens com nódulos no conjunto de dados da Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) para avaliação. Nossos experimentos mostraram que as CNNs foram capazes de alcançar resultados competitivos quando comparados com métodos da literatura. Nossa proposta obteve uma curva de operação (AUC) de 7.51 considerando 10 falsos positivos por imagem (FPPI) e uma sensibilidade de 71.4% e 81.0% com 2 e 5 FPPI, respectivamenteAbstract: Lung cancer, which is characterized by the presence of nodules, is the most common type of cancer around the world, as well as one of the most aggressive and deadliest cancer, with 20% of total cancer mortality. Lung cancer screening can be performed by radiologists analyzing chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, the detection of lung nodules is a difficult task due to their wide variability, human limitations of memory, distraction and fatigue, among other factors. These difficulties motivate the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for supporting radiologists in detecting lung nodules. Lung nodule classification is one of the main topics related to CAD systems. Although convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been demonstrated to perform well on many tasks, there are few explorations of their use for classifying lung nodules in CXR images. In this work, we proposed and analyzed a pipeline for detecting lung nodules in CXR images that includes lung area segmentation, potential nodule localization, and nodule candidate classification. We presented a method for classifying nodule candidates with a CNN trained from the scratch. The effectiveness of our method relies on the selection of data augmentation parameters, the design of a specialized CNN architecture, the use of dropout regularization on the network, inclusive in convolutional layers, and addressing the lack of nodule samples compared to background samples balancing mini-batches on each stochastic gradient descent iteration. All model selection decisions were taken using a CXR subset of the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC/IDRI) dataset separately. Thus, we used all images with nodules in the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) dataset for evaluation. Our experiments showed that CNNs were capable of achieving competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Inconsistencies across oncologists and prohibitive labor costs motivate automated approaches for this task. However, leading approaches are only applied to radiotherapy computed tomography (RTCT) images taken prior to treatment. This limits the performance as RTCT suffers from low contrast between the esophagus, tumor, and surrounding tissues. In this paper, we aim to exploit both RTCT and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging modalities to facilitate more accurate GTV segmentation. By utilizing PET, we emulate medical professionals who frequently delineate GTV boundaries through observation of the RTCT images obtained after prescribing radiotherapy and PET/CT images acquired earlier for cancer staging. To take advantage of both modalities, we present a two-stream chained segmentation approach that effectively fuses the CT and PET modalities via early and late 3D deep-network-based fusion. Furthermore, to effect the fusion and segmentation we propose a simple yet effective progressive semantically nested network (PSNN) model that outperforms more complicated models. Extensive 5-fold cross-validation on 110 esophageal cancer patients, the largest analysis to date, demonstrates that both the proposed two-stream chained segmentation pipeline and the PSNN model can significantly improve the quantitative performance over the previous state-of-the-art work by 11% in absolute Dice score (DSC) (from 0.654 to 0.764) and, at the same time, reducing the Hausdorff distance from 129 mm to 47 mm.",23,https://web.archive.org/web/20200930074206/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01524v2.pdf

Recently, methods based on deep learning have been able to solve SfT for the wide-baseline case in real-time, clearly surpassing classical methods. However, the main limitation of current methods is the need for fine tuning of the neural models to a specific geometry and appearance represented by the template texture map. We propose the first texture-generic deep learning SfT method which adapts to new texture maps at run-time, without the need for texture specific fine tuning. We achieve this by dividing the problem into a segmentation step and a registration and reconstruction step, both solved with deep learning. We include the template texture map as one of the neural inputs in both steps, training our models to adapt to different ones. We show that our method obtains comparable or better results to previous deep learning models, which are texture specific.

A myocardial infarction can cause heart muscle cells to die due to oxygen deficiency. The heart cells have no capability of regeneration, which means that the dead cells will not be replaced by new ones. The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is searching for a compound that can induce cell divisions of heart cells. The aim of this thesis is to investigate a method of measuring cell division rate. Time sequences of 2D microscope images are analyzed to detect cell divisions using a convolutional neural network. First, all sequences were processed by image registration and normalization. Then, a training set was generated by manual annotation. Data augmentation was used to increase the number of training examples of cell divisions, due to that cell divisions are rare. Mitosis takes several hours and is hard to detect on a single image. To make use of the temporal information, three images from the time sequence were used as input on multiple channels. The convolutional neural network learned to distinguish between two classes, cell division and background, after training on patches of size 60x60 pixels and three time steps. A sliding window was used to classify a full time sequence. The model learned to detect cell division in a fluorescent channel with a recall of 83% and in a bright field channel with a recall of 48%. A problem with the model detecting false positives was encountered. It was to some extent solved by active learning and using ensembles of models. To be able to measure the true cell division rate accurately, the number of false positives should be lower than the number of true positives. The developed model cannot be applied to count cell divisions to a high enough accuracy. Despite that, the thesis shows that a convolutional neural network can detect cell divisions in bright field images, which are difficult to detect by a human eye. Furthermore, the use of ensembles and active learning to improve the results showed promising result and could be further developed to create a model that can be used in pharmaceutical research.",27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/196600db7545818f98a33ffd0091691a37f58a6b

CBCT is a widely used intra-operative imaging modality in image-guided radiotherapy and surgery. A short scan followed by a filtered-backprojection is typically used for CBCT reconstruction. While data on the mid-plane (plane of source-detector rotation) is complete, off-mid-planes undergo different information deficiency and the computed reconstructions are approximate. This causes different reconstruction artifacts at off-mid-planes depending on slice locations, and therefore impedes accurate registration between CT and CBCT. To address this issue, we correct CBCT intensities by matching local intensity histograms slice by slice in conjunction with intensity-based deformable registration. This correction-registration step is repeated until the result image converges. We tested the proposed method on eight head-and-neck cancer cases and compared its performance with state-of-the-art registration methods, Bspline, demons, and optical flow, which are widely used for CT-CBCT registration. Normalized mutual-information (NMI), normalized cross-correlation (NCC), and structural similarity (SSIM) were computed as similarity measures for the performance evaluation.

The use of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, aka drones) equipped with various types of cameras is considered to be a flexible and low-cost platform for monitoring cultivated land changes. However, image pairs of the same scene taken from different viewpoints often contain discontinuous rotated images with illuminated variations. To address these problems, a novel small UAV based multi-viewpoint image registration method for monitoring cultivated land changes in mountainous terrain is proposed. First, a mixed feature descriptor (MFD) is defined for measuring global and local discrepancies between two datapoint sets, and a deterministic annealing scheme is employed to control the balance of the MFD. Second, the mixed feature finite mixture model (MFMM) is formulated to be the estimation of mixture densities. Finally, the double geometric constraints for -minimizing estimate based energy optimization is formulated in order to calculate a reasonable position in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Extensive experiments on UAV images with different viewpoints are conducted. Experimental results show that our method provides better performances in most cases after comparing with six state-of-the-art methods.",32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/566cf3fcadfc3688faf19daffa886300740f6e4a

Despite cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) being an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), many patients do not respond to CBT. Understanding the neural bases of treatment response may inform treatment refinement, thereby improving treatment response rates. Adequate working memory function is proposed to enable engagement in CBT.


METHOD
This study employed a Go/No-Go task to examine inhibitory function and its functional brain correlates as predictors of response to CBT in PTSD. Participants were recruited between October 2003 and May 2005. Thirteen treatment-seeking patients who met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD completed the Go/No-Go task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), after which they entered 8 once-weekly sessions of CBT. PTSD severity was measured before treatment and again at 6 months following treatment completion using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (primary outcome measure).


RESULTS
After controlling for initial PTSD severity and ongoing depressive symptoms, greater activity in left dorsal striatal (Z = 3.19, P = .001) and frontal (Z = 3.03, P = .001) networks during inhibitory control was associated with lower PTSD symptom severity after treatment, suggesting better treatment response.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that neural circuitry underpinning inhibitory control plays a role in the outcome of CBT for patients with PTSD.

In this paper, an improved mutual foreground LBP method is presented for achieving a better matching performance for contactless palm vein recognition. First, the normalized gradient-based maximal principal curvature algorithm and k -means method are utilized for texture extraction, which can effectively suppress noise and improve accuracy and robustness. Then, an LBP matching strategy was adopted for similarity measurements on the basis of extracted palm veins and their neighborhoods, which include the vast majority of useful distinctive information for identification while eliminating interference by excluding the background. To further improve the LBP performance, the matched pixel ratio was adopted to determine the best matching region (BMR). Finally, the matching score obtained in the process of finding the BMR was fused with results of LBP matching at the score level to further improve the identification performance. A series of rigorous contrast experiments using the palm vein data set in the CASIA multispectral palmprint image database were conducted. The obtained low equal error rate (0.267%) and comparisons with the most state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that our method is feasible and effective for contactless palm vein recognition.",34,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3b430466f7c7f26bf0dcb2f32646a67c0a611f0a

As accurate light delivery is imperative to PDT efficacy, the deformation of the pleural volume during the surgery is studied on its impact on the delivered light fluence. In this study, a three‐dimensional finite element‐based (3D FEM) deformable image registration is proposed to directly match the volume of lung to the volume of pleural cavity obtained during PDT to have accurate representation of the light fluence accumulated in the lung, heart and liver (organs‐at‐risk) during treatment. Methods A wand, comprised of a modified endotrachial tube filled with Intralipid and an optical fiber inside the tube, is used to deliver the treatment light. The position of the treatment is tracked using an optical tracking system with an attachment comprised of nine reflective passive markers that are seen by an infrared camera–based navigation system. This information is used to obtain the surface contours of the plural cavity and the cumulative light fluence on every point of the cavity surface that is being treated. The lung, heart, and liver geometry are also reconstructed from a series of computed tomography (CT) scans of the organs acquired in the same patient before and after the surgery. The contours obtained with the optical tracking system and CTs are imported into COMSOL Multiphysics, where the 3D FEM‐based deformable image registration is obtained. The delivered fluence values are assigned to the respective positions (x, y, and z) on the optical tracking contour. The optical tracking contour is considered as the reference, and the CT contours are used as the target, which will be deformed. The data from three patients formed the basis for this study. Results The physical correspondence between the CT and optical tracking geometries, taken at different times, from different imaging devices was established using the 3D FEM‐based image deformable registration. The volume of lung was matched to the volume of pleural cavity and the distribution of light fluence on the surface of the heart, liver and deformed lung volumes was obtained. Conclusion The method used is appropriate for analyzing problems over complicated domains, such as when the domain changes (as in a solid‐state reaction with a moving boundary), when the desired precision varies over the entire domain, or when the solution lacks smoothness. Implementing this method in real‐time for clinical applications and in situ monitoring of the under‐ or over‐ exposed regions to light during PDT can significantly improve the treatment for mesothelioma.",40,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c2e7e8d1ec31e101e82d422ce38b48953fd6f32

An atlas-based classification is generated by registering an image to an atlas, that is, by computing a semantically correct coordinate mapping between the two. In the present paper, the registration algorithm is an intensitybased non-rigid method that computes a free-form deformation (FFD) defined on a uniform grid of control points. The transformation is regularized by a weighted smoothness constraint term. Different atlases, as well as different parameterizations of the registration algorithm, lead to different and somewhat independent atlas-based classifiers. The outputs of these classifiers can be combined in order to improve overall classification accuracy. In an evaluation study, biomedical images from seven subjects are segmented 1) using three individual atlases; 2) using one atlas and three different resolutions of the FFD control point grid; 3) using one atlas and three different regularization constraint weights. In each case, the three individual segmentations are combined by Sum Rule fusion. For each individual and for each combined segmentation, its recognition rate (relative number of correctly labeled image voxels) is computed against a manual gold-standard segmentation. In all cases, classifier combination consistently improved classification accuracy. The biggest improvement was achieved using multiple atlases, a smaller gain resulted from multiple regularization constraint weights, and a marginal gain resulted from multiple control point spacings. We conclude that multi-classifier methods have a natural application to atlas-based segmentation and the potential to increase classification accuracy in real-world segmentation problems.",42,https://web.archive.org/web/20050327172444/http://www.stanford.edu:80/~rohlfing/publications/2004-rohlfing-cvpr-multi_classifier_segmentation.pdf

to the 3D garment surface. Our idea is to learn dense correspondences from
garment image silhouettes to a 2D-UV map of a 3D garment surface using shape
information alone, completely ignoring texture, which allows us to generalize
to the wide range of web images. Several experiments demonstrate that our model
is more accurate than widely used baselines such as thin-plate-spline warping
and image-to-image translation networks while being orders of magnitude faster.
Our model opens the door for applications such as virtual try-on, and allows

This paper proposes a technique for spatial normalization of brain images based on elastically deformable models. In the authors' approach they use a deformable surface algorithm to find a parametric representation of the outer cortical surface and then use this representation to obtain a map between corresponding regions of the outer cortex in two different images. Based on the resulting map, the authors then derive a three-dimensional elastic warping transformation which brings two images in register. This transformation models images as inhomogeneous elastic objects which are deformed into registration with each other by external force fields. The elastic properties of the images can vary from one region to the other, allowing more variable brain regions, such as the ventricles, to deform more freely than less variable ones. Finally, the authors use prestrained elasticity to model structural irregularities, and in particular the ventricular expansion occurring with aging or diseases.

To validate the ability and accuracy of DIR algorithms in organ at risk (OAR) contours mapping, seven intensity-based DIR strategies are tested on the planning CT and weekly CBCT images from six Head & Neck cancer patients who underwent a 6 ∼ 7 weeks intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Three similarity metrics, i.e. the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the percentage error (PE) and the Hausdorff distance (HD), are employed to measure the agreement between the propagated contours and the physician delineated ground truths. It is found that the performance of all the evaluated DIR algorithms declines as the treatment proceeds. No statistically significant performance difference is observed between different DIR algorithms (p> 0.05), except for the double force demons (DFD) which yields the worst result in terms of DSC and PE. For the metric HD, all the DIR algorithms behaved unsatisfactorily with no statistically significant performance difference (p= 0.273).

radiation on MRI radio frequency (RF) coils that complicates the analysis. Processing

and analysing serial sections of MRI scans to measure tissue volume is an additional

segmentation of specified regions of interest (ROI) and operator errors.

The work set out in this thesis has addressed this challenge with a specific focus on

skeletal muscle segmentation of the thigh. The aim was to develop an MRI segmentation

framework for the quadriceps muscles, femur and bone marrow. Four contributions of

this research include: (1) the development of a semi-automatic segmentation framework

for a single transverse-plane image; (2) automatic segmentation of a single transverseplane

image; (3) the automatic segmentation of multiple contiguous transverse-plane

images from a full MRI thigh scan; and (4) the use of deep learning for MRI thigh

quadriceps segmentation.

Novel image processing, statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms were developed

for all solutions and they were compared against current gold-standard manual

segmentation. Frameworks (1) and (3) require minimal input from the user to delineate

the muscle border. Overall, the frameworks in (1), (2) and (3) o↵er very good

output performance, with respective framework’s mean segmentation accuracy by JSI

knowledge, the framework initially propagates the a priori segmentation from
cine to LGE images via 2D translational registration. Two meshes representing
respectively endocardial and epicardial surfaces are then constructed with the
propagated contours. After construction, the two meshes are deformed towards
the myocardial edge points detected in both short-axis and long-axis LGE images
in a unified 3D coordinate system. Taking into account the intensity
characteristics of the LV in LGE images, we propose a novel parametric model of
the LV for consistent myocardial edge points detection regardless of
pathological status of the myocardium (infarcted or healthy) and of the type of
the LGE images (short-axis or long-axis). We have evaluated the proposed
framework with 21 sets of real patient and 4 sets of simulated phantom data.

approach to improve the precision of facial landmark detectors on both images
and video. Our key observation is that the detections of the same landmark in
adjacent frames should be coherent with registration, i.e., optical flow.
Interestingly, the coherency of optical flow is a source of supervision that
does not require manual labeling, and can be leveraged during detector
training. For example, we can enforce in the training loss function that a
detected landmark at frame$_{t-1}$ followed by optical flow tracking from
frame$_{t-1}$ to frame$_t$ should coincide with the location of the detection
at frame$_t$. Essentially, supervision-by-registration augments the training
loss function with a registration loss, thus training the detector to have
output that is not only close to the annotations in labeled images, but also
consistent with registration on large amounts of unlabeled videos. End-to-end
training with the registration loss is made possible by a differentiable
Lucas-Kanade operation, which computes optical flow registration in the forward
pass, and back-propagates gradients that encourage temporal coherency in the
detector. The output of our method is a more precise image-based facial
landmark detector, which can be applied to single images or video. With
supervision-by-registration, we demonstrate (1) improvements in facial landmark
detection on both images (300W, ALFW) and video (300VW, Youtube-Celebrities),
and (2) significant reduction of jittering in video detections.",66,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00966v2

The accuracy and robustness of the deformable registration largely depend on the definition of appropriate objective function, measuring the similarity between the images. Among them the multi-dimensional modality independent neighbourhood descriptor (MIND) is a promising method, yet its ability is limited by non-uniform bias fields and image noise, etc. Motivated by the fact that Log-Euclidean metric has promising invariance properties such as inversion invariant and similarity invariant, this paper introduces an objective function that embeds Log-Euclidean similarity metric between patches to form a multi-dimensional descriptor. The Gaussian-like penalty function consisting of the log-Euclidean metric between images to be registered is incorporated to better reflect the degree of preserving feature discriminability and structure ordering.

In particular, we show that a consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize convincing bullet-time videos of short and simple scenes.

Due to the highly nonlinear radiometric relationship, it is quite challenging to find common features between images of different modal types. This paper resorts to the deep neural network, and tries to learn descriptors for multimodal image patch matching, which is the key issue of image registration. A Siamese fully convolutional network is set up and trained with a novel loss function, which adopts the strategy of maximizing the feature distance between positive and hard negative samples. The two branches of the Siamese network are connected by the convolutional operation, resulting in the similarity score between the two input image patches. The similarity score value is used, not only for correspondence point location, but also for outlier identification. A generalized workflow for deep feature based multimodal RS image registration is constructed, including the training data curation, candidate feature point generation, and outlier removal.

With the recent advance in artificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have been widely applied to medical images, constituting a significant proportion of medical data. The techniques of automated medical image analysis have the potential to benefit general clinical procedures, e.g., disease screening, malignancy diagnosis, patient risk prediction, and surgical planning. Although preliminary success takes place, the robustness of these approaches requires to be cautiously validated and sufficiently guaranteed before their application to real-world clinical problems. 
In this thesis, we propose different approaches to improve the robustness of deep learning algorithms for automated medical image analysis. (i) In terms of network architecture, we leverage the advantages of both 2D and 3D networks, and propose an alternative 2.5D approach for 3D organ segmentation. (ii) To improve data efficiency and utilize large-scale unlabeled medical data, we propose a unified framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation and domain adaptation. (iii) For the safety-critical applications, we design a unified approach for failure detection and anomaly segmentation.

We coined the algorithm deep step patterns, in short DeepSPa. Most existing deep learning based methods require a set of manually labeled training data with known corresponding spatial transformations, which limits the size of training datasets. By contrast, our method is fully automatic and scale well to different image modalities with no human intervention. We generate feature classes from simple step patterns within patches of connecting edges formed by vascular junctions in multiple retinal imaging modalities. We leverage CNN to learn and optimize the input patches to be used for image registration. Spatial transformations are estimated based on the output possibility of the fully connected layer of CNN for a pair of images. One of the key advantages of the proposed algorithm is its robustness to non-linear intensity changes, which widely exist on retinal images due to the difference of acquisition modalities. We validate our algorithm on extensive challenging datasets comprising poor quality multimodal retinal images which are adversely affected by pathologies (diseases), speckle noise and low resolutions.

To tackle these problems, a novel model is proposed in this paper by compounding local invariant features and global deformable geometry. This model has four steps. First, a set of highly-repeatable and highly-robust local invariant features, called Key Features Model (KFM), are extracted by an effective matching strategy. Second, local features can be matched more accurately through the KFM for the purpose of initializing a global deformable model. Third, the positional relationship between the KFM and the global deformable model can be used to precisely pinpoint all landmarks after initialization. And fourth, the final pose of the global deformable model is determined by an iterative process with a lower time cost. Through the practical experiments, the paper finds three important conclusions. First, it proves that the KFM can detect the matching feature points well. Second, the precision of landmark locations adjusted by the modeled relationship between KFM and global deformable model is greatly improved.

Currently, the most common patient positioning methods expose healthy tissue of the patient's body to extra dangerous radiations. Other non-invasive positioning methods are either not very accurate or are very costly for an average hospital. In this thesis, we explore the possibility of developing a system comprised of affordable hardware and advanced computer vision algorithms that facilitates patient positioning. Our algorithms are based on the usage of affordable RGB-D sensors, image features, ArUco planar markers, and other geometry registration methods. Furthermore, we take advantage of consumer-level computing hardware to make our systems widely accessible. More specifically, we avoid the usage of approaches that need to take advantage of dedicated GPU hardware for general-purpose computing since they are more costly. In different publications, we explore the usage of the mentioned tools to increase the accuracy of reconstruction/localization of the patient in its pose. We also take into account the visualization of the patient's target position with respect to their current position in order to assist the person who performs patient positioning. Furthermore, we make usage of augmented reality in conjunction with a real-time 3D tracking algorithm for better interaction between the program and the operator. We also solve more fundamental problems about ArUco markers that could be used in the future to improve our systems. These include highquality multi-camera calibration and mapping using ArUco markers plus detection of these markers in event cameras which are very useful in the presence of fast camera movement. In the end, we conclude that it is possible to increase the accuracy of 3D reconstruction and localization by combining current computer vision algorithms with fiducial planar markers with RGB-D sensors. This is reflected in the low amount of error we have achieved in our experiments for patient positioning, pushing forward the state of the art for this application.En el tratamiento de tumores malignos en el cuerpo, el posicionamiento del paciente en las sesiones de radioterapia es una cuestión crucial. Actualmente, los métodos más comunes de posicionamiento del paciente exponen tejido sano del mismo a radiaciones peligrosas debido a que no es posible asegurar que la posición del paciente siempre sea la misma que la que tuvo cuando se planificó la zona a radiar. Los métodos que se usan actualmente, o no son precisos o tienen costes que los hacen inasequibles para ser usados en hospitales con financiación limitada. En esta Tesis hemos analizado la posibilidad de desarrollar un sistema compuesto por hardware de bajo coste y métodos avanzados de visión por ordenador que ayuden a que el posicionamiento del paciente sea el mismo en las diferentes sesiones de radioterapia, con respecto a su pose cuando fue se planificó la zona a radiar. La solución propuesta como resultado de la Tesis se basa en el uso de sensores RGB-D, características extraídas de la imagen, marcadores cuadrados denominados ArUco y métodos de registro de la geometría en la imagen. Además, en la solución propuesta, se aprovecha la existencia de hardware convencional de bajo coste para hacer nuestro sistema ampliamente accesible. Más específicamente, evitamos el uso de enfoques que necesitan aprovechar GPU, de mayores costes, para computación de propósito general. Se han obtenido diferentes publicaciones para conseguir el objetivo final. Las mismas describen métodos para aumentar la precisión de la reconstrucción y la localización del paciente en su pose, teniendo en cuenta la visualización de la posición ideal del paciente con respecto a su posición actual, para ayudar al profesional que realiza la colocación del paciente. También se han propuesto métodos de realidad aumentada junto con algoritmos para seguimiento 3D en tiempo real para conseguir una mejor interacción entre el sistema ideado y el profesional que debe realizar esa labor. De forma añadida, también se han propuesto soluciones para problemas fundamentales relacionados con el uso de marcadores cuadrados que han sido utilizados para conseguir el objetivo de la Tesis. Las soluciones propuestas pueden ser empleadas en el futuro para mejorar otros sistemas. Los problemas citados incluyen la calibración y el mapeo multicámara de alta calidad utilizando los marcadores y la detección de estos marcadores en cámaras de eventos, que son muy útiles en presencia de movimientos rápidos de la cámara. Al final, concluimos que es posible aumentar la precisión de la reconstrucción y localización en 3D combinando los actuales algoritmos de visión por ordenador, que usan marcadores cuadrados de referencia, con sensores RGB-D.

This work adresses that need by providing a novel automatic initialization, which enables end to end registration. First, a neural network is trained once to detect a set of anatomical landmarks on simulated X-rays. A domain randomization scheme is proposed to enable the network to overcome the challenge of being trained purely on simulated data and run inference on real Xrays. Then, for each patient CT, a patient-specific landmark extraction scheme is used. It is based on backprojecting and clustering the previously trained networks predictions on a set of simulated X-rays. Next, the network is retrained to detect the new landmarks. Finally the combination of network and 3D landmark locations is used to compute the initialization using a perspective-n-point algorithm. During the computation of the pose, a weighting scheme is introduced to incorporate the confidence of the network in detecting the landmarks. The algorithm is evaluated on the pelvis using both real and simulated x-rays.

Imaging plays and important role in the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. Diagnostic imaging with computed tomography (CT) results in large 3D data sets which have to be inspected by the radiologist or cardiologist. Computer aided diagnosis approaches to analyze the individual arteries helps the medical doctors to look for suspicious regions in these arteries and to rule out regions which are not interesting to investigate. This information can be combined in risk models. Image processing also plays an important role during the treatment of coronary artery disease. It provides essential measurements for device selection like scaffold length and diameter and treatment planning like the exact location of the stent placement. In this lecture the different aspect of using advanced image processing techniques for the diagnoses and treatment of coronary artery disease will be presented. Why does synthesized data improve classification of multi-sequence medical images? Gijs van Tulder (work done with Marleen de Bruijne) Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam, Erasmus MC Email: g.vantulder@erasmusmc.nl Incomplete datasets can make it difficult to train a classifier, because most classifiers assume that the same data is available for all training samples. The classification and registration of incomplete multimodal medical images, such as multi-sequence MRI with missing sequences, can sometimes be improved by replacing the missing modalities with synthesized data. This may seem counter-intuitive: synthetic data is derived from data that is already available, so it does not add new information. Why can it still improve performance? We will discuss possible explanations, based on experiments with two classifiers (linear SVMs and random forests) and two synthesis models (neural networks and restricted Boltzmann machines) on data from a brain tumor segmentation challenge with multi-modal MRI scans.

The proposed method applies multi-scale super-pixel classification to detect regions of interest in wholeslide images (WSIs). Subsequently, spatial clustering is utilized to delineate regions representing meaningful structures within the tissue. A classifier employing statistical and structural texture features and architectural features is then trained to discriminate between DCIS and benign/normal structures. Evaluation was conducted both on the slide and the lesion level using (F)ROC analysis. The result of the per-slide evaluation shows a sensitivity of 95% and 100% at an average of 2 and 2.6 false positive detections per WSI, respectively. The results of the per-lesion evaluation show that it is possible to detect 80% and 83% of the DCIS lesions in an abnormal slide, at an average of 2.0 and 3.0 false positive detections per WSI, respectively. Collectively, the result of the experiments demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed method as well as its potential for application in routine pathological diagnostics.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had huge successes in computer vision, but they lack the natural ability to incorporate the anatomical location in their decision making process, hindering success in some medical image analysis tasks. In this work, to integrate the anatomical location information into the network, we propose several deep CNN architectures that consider multi-scale patches or take explicit location features while training. We apply and compare the proposed architectures for segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in brain MR images on a large dataset. As a result, we observe that the CNNs that incorporate location information substantially outperform a conventional segmentation method with hand-crafted features as well as CNNs that do not integrate location information. On a test set of 46 scans, the best configuration of our networks obtained a Dice score of 0.791, compared to 0.797 for an independent human observer.

It offers the possibility of examination of a large number of images with time and cost savings and offers more objective measurements than current observation techniques. Advantages in a clinical context include the potential to perform automated screening for conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, and hence to reduce the workload required from manual trained graders. The high resolution fundus camera images generate a wealth of information, and due to the large size and huge numbers, specialized software is developed to do a fully automatic analysis and diagnosis. The integration of the many individual applications in one integrated system, both for the researcher and clinical user, is the main aim of RetinaCheck platform. RetinaCheck platform facilitates the automatic retinal image analysis by establishing a common repeatable procedure, thus increasing the performance and reliability of the entire analysis, and it helps with the image storage and management, allowing the collaboration between experts in different locations for the different studies. This platform includes several tools for automatic retinal image analysis, such as vessel segmentation and tracking, optic disc and fovea detection, optic segmentation, vessel caliber measurement, artery/vein classification, microaneurysm, hemorrhage and drusen detection, assessment of alternation in vessel calibers and etc. Several requirements were considered in the development of this software. This interface automatically computes several parameters from retinal images in a repeatable and objective manner. RetinaCheck allows the integration of new image processing modules easily and it will provide several features and tools to increase interactivity and usability.

The translation of such pipeline to the clinical level will provide a new class of biomarkers that objectively describe the neuro-musculo-skeletal determinants of pathological locomotion and complement current clinical assessment techniques, which often rely on subjective judgment.",83,https://web.archive.org/web/20200505113529/https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/bitstream/handle/10072/100850/SartoriPUB2689.pdf;jsessionid=55FD33857436EA5CAFB009CB1C18F076?sequence=1

We have begun experiments at the Multiple Mirror Telescope to remove these errors with tip, tilt, and piston control of pieces of the wave front that are defined by the telescope’s six 1.8-m primary mirrors. We present long-exposure images that were recorded at the telescope with a resolution of as high as 0.08 arcsec under piston control, and 0.32 arcsec under tilt control, by use of an adaptive instrument designed to restore diffraction-limited imaging in the near infrared. Of particular importance for high-resolution imaging is the control of the piston or the mean phase errors between the segments. These errors can be calculated from the Fourier transform of the short-exposure combined-focus image, but the accuracy of the reconstructed wave front depends critically on the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. We present a theoretical analysis of the effects of photon and detector read noise on the derived piston errors and computer simulations of wave-front reconstructor algorithms. We find that a Wiener filter combined with nonlinear weighting of the piston errors minimizes the impact of noise. Finally, we summarize expected improvements to our system and discuss the application of these techniques to forthcoming large telescopes.",86,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ab1545c5d32ba47fbd9934fc4d3f9606ea64dfd
H. A. Taha,Human-Machine Interaction by Tracking Hand Movements,2013-05-11 00:00:00,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"The vision-based hand tracking and gesture recognition is an extremely challenging problem due to the intricate nature of hand gestures this is a reason that available computer vision algorithms are computationally complex. In this research work a new methodology for 3D human hand gestures detection and recognition is proposed, which can be used for natural and intuitive human-computer interaction and other robotic systems. The proposed method based on Fourier’s descriptors, neural networks and morphology approaches to solve the problem of human hand tracking and gesture recognition of 3D objects from a single silhouette image. There are many constrains and challenges are there for the recognition of an object, like size change, translation, rotation around the three axes, partial occlusion, low intensity of light as well as the deformation of the shape. In this research work we used invariant Fourier’s descriptors and back propagation neural networks techniques for 3D objects recognitions from their 2D silhouette pattern to solve above mentioned challenges. The proposed approach used Fourier’s descriptors coefficients and back propagation neural network with different numbers of hidden layers to build the optimal classifier of 3D pattern from a single silhouette image. Besides that, another method is proposed using image processing and morphology technique in conjunction with various mathematical formulas to calculate hand position and orientation. The recognised objects are exposed to different intensities of light, are partially occluded, with size change, translation, rotation about all the axes and we used also deformed shapes. This new proposed method was applied and tested on the simulated Manipulated Robotic System (UniMAP Robot Manipulator Simulation System) that allows this robotic system to act as an intelligent system to track a human hand in 3D space and estimate its orientation and position in real time with the goal of ultimately using the algorithm with a robotic spherical wrist system. During experiment, there was no need for continuous camera calibration, and it required only once at the beginning for the registration of the hand and using proposed technique large number of hand movements and orientations are correctly identify. Experimental result shows that proposed method is a robust technique, unlike other approaches that use costly leaning functions or generalization methods. The high performance was achieved during experiments because of the accurate hand movement identification and the low computational load that results in a fast processing time. The proposed method could therefore be used with different types of teleoperated robotic manipulators or in other human-computer interaction applications in which a fast processing time was important.",87,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1792fba856df8cf578a1629bebef65065dff7cf7

There are well-established measurements that radiologists use for diseases assessment such as ejection fraction, volume of four chambers, and myocardium mass. These measurements are derived as outcomes of precise segmentation of the heart and its substructures. The aim of this paper is to provide such measurements through an accurate image segmentation algorithm that automatically delineates seven substructures of the heart from MRI and/or CT scans. Our proposed method is based on multi-planar deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with an adaptive fusion strategy where we automatically utilize complementary information from different planes of the 3D scans for improved delineations. For CT and MRI, we have separately designed three CNNs (the same architectural configuration) for three planes, and have trained the networks from scratch for voxel-wise labeling for the following cardiac structures: myocardium of left ventricle (Myo), left atrium (LA), left ventricle (LV), right atrium (RA), right ventricle (RV), ascending aorta (Ao), and main pulmonary artery (PA). We have evaluated the proposed method with 4-fold-cross-validation on the multi-modality whole heart segmentation challenge (MM-WHS 2017) dataset. The precision and dice index of 0.93 and 0.90, and 0.87 and 0.85 were achieved for CT and MR images, respectively.

"Zhou, Xiaoyun",3D shape instantiation for intra-operative navigation from a single 2D projection,2020-03-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,10.25560/80269,"Unlike traditional open surgery where surgeons can see the operation area clearly, in robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), a surgeon’s view of the region of interest is usually limited. Currently, 2D images from fluoroscopy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), endoscopy or ultrasound are used for intra-operative guidance as real-time 3D volumetric acquisition is not always possible due to the acquisition speed or exposure constraints. 3D reconstruction, however, is key to navigation in complex in vivo geometries and can help resolve this issue. Novel 3D shape instantiation schemes are developed in this thesis, which can reconstruct the high-resolution 3D shape of a target from limited 2D views, especially a single 2D projection or slice. To achieve a complete and automatic 3D shape instantiation pipeline, segmentation schemes based on deep learning are also investigated. These include normalization schemes for training U-Nets and network architecture design of Atrous Convolutional Neural Networks (ACNNs).

For U-Net normalization, four popular normalization methods are reviewed, then Instance-Layer Normalization (ILN) is proposed. It uses a sigmoid function to linearly weight the feature map after instance normalization and layer normalization, and cascades group normalization after the weighted feature map. Detailed validation results potentially demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed ILN for effective and robust segmentation of different anatomies.

For network architecture design in training Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), the newly proposed ACNN is compared to traditional U-Net where max-pooling and deconvolutional layers are essential. Only convolutional layers are used in the proposed ACNN with different atrous rates and it has been shown that the method is able to provide a fully-covered receptive field with a minimum number of atrous convolutional layers. ACNN enhances the robustness and generalizability of the analysis scheme by cascading multiple atrous blocks. Validation results have shown the proposed method achieves comparable results to the U-Net in terms of medical image segmentation, whilst reducing the trainable parameters, thus improving the convergence and real-time instantiation speed. 

For 3D shape instantiation of soft and deforming organs during MIS, Sparse Principle Component Analysis (SPCA) has been used to analyse a  3D Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and to determine the most informative scan plane. Synchronized 2D images are then scanned at the most informative scan plane and are expressed in a 2D SSM. Kernel Partial Least Square Regression (KPLSR) has been applied to learn the relationship between the 2D and 3D SSM. It has been shown that the KPLSR-learned model developed in this thesis is able to predict the intra-operative 3D target shape from a single 2D projection or slice, thus permitting real-time 3D navigation. Validation results have shown the intrinsic accuracy achieved and the potential clinical value of the technique.

The proposed 3D shape instantiation scheme is further applied to intra-operative stent graft deployment for the robot-assisted treatment of aortic aneurysms. Mathematical modelling is first used to simulate the stent graft characteristics. This is then followed by the Robust Perspective-n-Point (RPnP) method to instantiate the 3D pose of fiducial markers of the graft. Here, Equally-weighted Focal U-Net is proposed with a cross-entropy and an additional focal loss function. Detailed validation has been performed on patient-specific stent grafts with an accuracy between 1-3mm. Finally, the relative merits and potential pitfalls of all the methods developed in this thesis are discussed, followed by potential future research directions and additional challenges that need to be tackled.Open Acces",91,https://core.ac.uk/download/326509814.pdf

However, current evaluation methods and quality requirements for temporary structures are based on subjective visual inspection by safety managers. Accordingly, the assessment process and results depend on an inspector's competence, experience, and human factors, making objective analysis complex. The safety inspections performed by specialized services bring additional costs and increase evaluation times. Therefore, a temporary structure quality and safety evaluation system based on experts' experience and independent of the human factor is the relevant solution in intelligent construction. This study aimed to present a quality evaluation system prototype for scaffolding parts based on computer vision. The main steps of the proposed system development are preparing a dataset, designing a neural network (NN) model, and training and evaluating the model. Since traditional methods of preparing a dataset are very laborious and time-consuming, this work used mixed real and synthetic datasets modeled in Blender. Further, the resulting datasets were processed using artificial intelligence algorithms to obtain information about defect type, size, and location.

Here, we present the first microfluidic technologies capable of simultaneous electrical, chemical, and optical interrogation of these soft, deformable organisms.

accomplish this, fiber tracts are represented by an intrinsic mean along with

be applied to a variety of practical applications such as gaming, filming,
photographic filtering, and image dehazing. To generate plausible haze, we
study two less-touched but challenging problems in hazy image rendering,
namely, i) how to estimate the transmission map from a single image without
auxiliary information, and ii) how to adaptively learn the airlight from
exemplars, i.e., unpaired real hazy images. To this end, we propose a neural
rendering method for image hazing, dubbed as HazeGEN. To be specific, HazeGEN
is a knowledge-driven neural network which estimates the transmission map by
leveraging a new prior, i.e., there exists the structure similarity (e.g.,
contour and luminance) between the transmission map and the input clean image.
To adaptively learn the airlight, we build a neural module based on another new
prior, i.e., the rendered hazy image and the exemplar are similar in the
airlight distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first
attempt to deeply rendering hazy images in an unsupervised fashion. Comparing
with existing haze generation methods, HazeGEN renders the hazy images in an
unsupervised, learnable, and controllable manner, thus avoiding the
labor-intensive efforts in paired data collection and the domain-shift issue in
haze generation. Extensive experiments show the promising performance of our
method comparing with some baselines in both qualitative and quantitative
comparisons. The code will be released on GitHub after acceptance.",99,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06681v1
