Common registration schemes utilize some form of similarity measures in order to evaluate affine transformation parameters. In the proposed scheme, feedforward neural networks are employed as a means of providing translation, rotation and scaling parameters with respect to reference and observed image sets. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) features are extracted as inputs to the network. Experimental results with several deformed and noisy images indicate that the proposed algorithm is both accurate and remarkably robust to diverse noisy conditions.",5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aca05b6972117368750c9a8c2172e0033b8e4eeb

Among its most important applications, one may cite: 1) multi-modality fusion, where information acquired by different imaging devices or protocols is fused to facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning; 2) longitudinal studies, where temporal structural or anatomical changes are investigated; and 3) population modeling and statistical atlases used to study normal anatomical variability. In this paper, we attempt to give an overview of deformable registration methods, putting emphasis on the most recent advances in the domain. Additional emphasis has been given to techniques applied to medical images. In order to study image registration methods in depth, their main components are identified and studied independently. The most recent techniques are presented in a systematic fashion. The contribution of this paper is to provide an extensive account of registration techniques in a systematic manner.",21,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/681f3b92ee2e53dc10c11238a8da353e5c58de2c

In the proposed scheme, the spectrums of the acquired images are computed, the Fourier coefficients within a selected central window of each spectrum are extracted and fed as inputs to the neural network. The feed forward neural network is implemented to estimate the transformation, defined in terms of the translation, rotation and magnification parameters, to align the corresponding images. This approach does not estimate the various registration parameters separately. They are estimated simultaneously leading to a better-optimized set of registration parameters. The approach is successful and yields better results than another Fourier based registration technique. The approach is validated on 2D images. However, it can be easily extended to 3-D application",43,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9223db1dc7997a92fd9c2a6ec267315f6952a363

Even though a deformation field related to the point correspondence between fixed and moving images are high-dimensional in nature, we assume that these deformation fields form a low dimensional manifold in many real world applications. Thus, in our method, a neural network generates an embedding of the deformation field from a low dimensional vector. This lowdimensional manifold formulation avoids the intractability associated with the high dimensional search space that most other methods face during image registration. As a result, while most methods rely on explicit and handcrafted regularization of the deformation fields, our algorithm relies on implicitly regularizing the network parameters. The proposed method generates deformation fields from latent low dimensional space by minimizing a dissimilarity metric between a fixed image and a warped moving image. Our method removes the need for a large dataset to optimize the proposed network. The proposed method is quantitatively evaluated using images from the MICCAI ACDC challenge. The results demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance in comparison with a moving mesh registration algorithm, and also it correlates well with independent manual segmentations by an expert.",63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2a684f7f24e8f1448204b3f9f00b26d34e9a03b

However, more complex applications have arisen, such as assessing response to radiation therapy over time, registering images pre- and post-surgery, and auto-segmentation from atlases. These applications require innovative registration algorithms to achieve accurate alignment. The goal of this session is to highlight emerging registration technology and these new applications. The state of the art in image registration will be presented from an engineering perspective. Translational clinical applications will also be discussed to tie these new registration approaches together with imaging and radiation therapy applications in specific diseases such as cervical and lung cancers.

Current deformation decomposition methods can be categorized into cascade-based methods and pyramid-based methods. However, cascade-based methods suffer from heavy computational burdens and long inference time due to their structures of repeated subnetworks, while the effectiveness of pyramid-based methods is constrained by their limited numbers of resolution levels. In this paper, to address both the insufficient and inefficient decomposition problems in current deformation decomposition methods, we propose a recursive decomposition network (RDN) to offer a novel solution for deformable image registration. Stage-wise recursion can efficiently decompose a large deformation into different pyramid estimation stages without using repeated subnetworks like in cascade-based methods. Level-wise recursion can sufficiently decompose the deformation inside each resolution level instead of only one-time estimation like in pyramid-based methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two representative datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RDN.",71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2641dcd6f4e14e735186fc7b0870f981514d214c

Classical registration algorithms usually require a high computational cost for iterative optimizations. Although deep-learning-based methods have been developed for fast image registration, it is still challenging to obtain realistic continuous deformations from a moving image to a fixed image with less topological folding problem. To address this, here we present a novel diffusion-model-based image registration method, called DiffuseMorph. DiffuseMorph not only generates synthetic deformed images through reverse diffusion but also allows image registration by deformation fields. Specifically, the deformation fields are generated by the conditional score function of the deformation between the moving and fixed images, so that the registration can be performed from continuous deformation by simply scaling the latent feature of the score. Experimental results on 2D facial and 3D medical image registration tasks demonstrate that our method provides flexible deformations with topology preservation capability.",72,https://web.archive.org/web/20221001071500/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05149v2.pdf

The techniques are particularly effective for registration problems in which one or both of the images to be registered contains significant levels of noise. A brief overview of existing deformable registration techniques is presented, and experiments using B-spline free-form deformation registration models demonstrate that ordinary deformable registration techniques fail to produce accurate results in the presence of significant levels of noise.

Accurate registration of noisy images is achieved by obtaining a hierarchical multiscale decomposition of the images and iteratively registering the resulting components.

The proposed method can be seen as a tradeoff between the landmark and intensity driven data registration techniques. The algorithm is fast, robust and offers high registration accuracy. The algorithm enables to include complex constraints on the allowable data deformations. It is shown that some of these constraints permit to treat part of the data as rigid objects or restrict its deformation to a predefined shape.

In addition to these components, the optimization also includes one or more regularization terms such as the smoothness of the underlying deformation or restrictions based on the physical properties of organs. It is also common for most of the algorithms to take a multi‐resolution approach to capture large initial deformations as well as to speed up the registration process. Understanding and proper choice of such parameters are critical to a successful registration. The effects of different choices of parameters will be presented using public domain algorithms as well as commercial software. Learning objectives: 1.

However, deep learning-based registration models have mostly relied on spatially-invariant regularization. Here, we introduce an end-to-end framework that uses neural networks to learn a spatially-varying deformation regularizer directly from data. The hyperparameter of the proposed regularizer is conditioned into the network, enabling easy tuning of the regularization strength. The proposed method is built upon a Transformer-based model, but it can be readily adapted to any network architecture. We thoroughly evaluated the proposed approach using publicly available datasets and observed a significant performance improvement while maintaining smooth deformation.

To solve this problem, we present a novel approach to optimizing CP locations and simultaneously establishing the proper correspondence between these points. An expectation-maximization-like model and a refinement mechanism are proposed to achieve CP optimization as well as correspondence establishment.

The registration methodology is a hybrid approach that combines registration without exact point correspondence via multi-object principal axes, and registration with point correspondence via polynomial transform. Neural computation is used to combine the derived individual principal axes solutions for each object in a committee machine formulation and to obtain the polynomial transform based on extracted control points using a multi layer perceptrons (MLP). Three examples are presented to demonstrate the techniques involved in the process. The first example uses four Gaussian clusters and focuses on the combination of the multiple transforms into a composite transform using finite mixture modeling techniques. The next examples present the complete process for prostate cancer registration and breast sequence analysis respectively. To verify performance, the results are compared to non-neural based implementations and other existing registration methods.",96,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5445ebff40012cf0f825338d7c6eeff71a91b09a

Classical registration algorithms perform an iterative pair-wise optimization to compute a deformation field that aligns two images. Recent learning-based approaches leverage large image datasets to learn a function that rapidly estimates a deformation for a given image pair. In both strategies, the accuracy of the resulting spatial correspondences is strongly influenced by the choice of certain hyperparameter values. However, an effective hyperparameter search consumes substantial time and human effort as it often involves training multiple models for different fixed hyperparameter values and may lead to suboptimal registration. We propose an amortized hyperparameter learning strategy to alleviate this burden by learning the impact of hyperparameters on deformation fields. We design a meta network, or hypernetwork, that predicts the parameters of a registration network for input hyperparameters, thereby comprising a single model that generates the optimal deformation field corresponding to given hyperparameter values. This strategy enables fast, high-resolution hyperparameter search at test-time, reducing the inefficiency of traditional approaches while increasing flexibility. We also demonstrate additional benefits of HyperMorph, including enhanced robustness to model initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter values specific to a dataset, image contrast, task, or even anatomical region, all without the need to retrain models. We make our code publicly available at http://hypermorph.voxelmorph.net.",97,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e372bea94c05e0396ee9c919fc099d4f5695166

Using entropy shape modelling is performed by connecting the point sets with the highest probability of curvature information, while with GNG the points sets are connected using nearest-neighbour relationships derived from competitive hebbian learning.
