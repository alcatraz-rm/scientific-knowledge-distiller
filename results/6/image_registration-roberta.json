Common registration schemes utilize some form of similarity measures in order to evaluate affine transformation parameters. In the proposed scheme, feedforward neural networks are employed as a means of providing translation, rotation and scaling parameters with respect to reference and observed image sets. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) features are extracted as inputs to the network. Experimental results with several deformed and noisy images indicate that the proposed algorithm is both accurate and remarkably robust to diverse noisy conditions.",

        "abstract": "Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing. Among its most important applications, one may cite: 1) multi-modality fusion, where information acquired by different imaging devices or protocols is fused to facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning; 2) longitudinal studies, where temporal structural or anatomical changes are investigated; and 3) population modeling and statistical atlases used to study normal anatomical variability. In this paper, we attempt to give an overview of deformable registration methods, putting emphasis on the most recent advances in the domain. Additional emphasis has been given to techniques applied to medical images. In order to study image registration methods in depth, their main components are identified and studied independently. The most recent techniques are presented in a systematic fashion. The contribution of this paper is to provide an extensive account of registration techniques in a systematic manner.",

In the proposed scheme, the spectrums of the acquired images are computed, the Fourier coefficients within a selected central window of each spectrum are extracted and fed as inputs to the neural network. The feed forward neural network is implemented to estimate the transformation, defined in terms of the translation, rotation and magnification parameters, to align the corresponding images. This approach does not estimate the various registration parameters separately. They are estimated simultaneously leading to a better-optimized set of registration parameters. The approach is successful and yields better results than another Fourier based registration technique. The approach is validated on 2D images. However, it can be easily extended to 3-D application",

The aligning transformation is simply found by solving a system of non-linear equations. Each equation is generated by integrating the product of a set of polynomial functions and the image intensity function over corresponding image domains. The capabilities of the algorithm have been studied on synthetic and real datasets on which it compares favorably to state of the art methods in terms of alignment accuracy.",

In this paper, we present a generic, fast, and accurate diffeomorphic image registration framework that leverages neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). We model each voxel as a moving particle and consider the set of all voxels in a 3D image as a high-dimensional dynamical system whose trajectory determines the targeted deformation field. Compared with traditional optimization based methods, our framework reduces the running time from tens of minutes to tens of seconds. Compared with recent datadriven deep learning methods, our framework is more accessible since it does not require large amounts of training data. Our experiments show that the registration results of *Equal contribution. our method outperform the-state-of-arts under various metrics, indicating that our modeling approach is well fitted for the task of deformable image registration.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new deformable image registration method based on a fully connected neural network is proposed. Even though a deformation field related to the point correspondence between fixed and moving images are high-dimensional in nature, we assume that these deformation fields form a low dimensional manifold in many real world applications. Thus, in our method, a neural network generates an embedding of the deformation field from a low dimensional vector. This lowdimensional manifold formulation avoids the intractability associated with the high dimensional search space that most other methods face during image registration. As a result, while most methods rely on explicit and handcrafted regularization of the deformation fields, our algorithm relies on implicitly regularizing the network parameters. The proposed method generates deformation fields from latent low dimensional space by minimizing a dissimilarity metric between a fixed image and a warped moving image. Our method removes the need for a large dataset to optimize the proposed network. The proposed method is quantitatively evaluated using images from the MICCAI ACDC challenge. The results demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance in comparison with a moving mesh registration algorithm, and also it correlates well with independent manual segmentations by an expert.",

        "abstract": "Deformable image registration has now been commercially available for several years, with solid performance in a number of sites and for several applications including contour and dose mapping. However, more complex applications have arisen, such as assessing response to radiation therapy over time, registering images pre- and post-surgery, and auto-segmentation from atlases. These applications require innovative registration algorithms to achieve accurate alignment. The goal of this session is to highlight emerging registration technology and these new applications. The state of the art in image registration will be presented from an engineering perspective. Translational clinical applications will also be discussed to tie these new registration approaches together with imaging and radiation therapy applications in specific diseases such as cervical and lung cancers.\n\n\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. To understand developing techniques and algorithms in deformable image registration that are likely to translate into clinical tools in the near future. 2.

Current deformation decomposition methods can be categorized into cascade-based methods and pyramid-based methods. However, cascade-based methods suffer from heavy computational burdens and long inference time due to their structures of repeated subnetworks, while the effectiveness of pyramid-based methods is constrained by their limited numbers of resolution levels. In this paper, to address both the insufficient and inefficient decomposition problems in current deformation decomposition methods, we propose a recursive decomposition network (RDN) to offer a novel solution for deformable image registration. Stage-wise recursion can efficiently decompose a large deformation into different pyramid estimation stages without using repeated subnetworks like in cascade-based methods. Level-wise recursion can sufficiently decompose the deformation inside each resolution level instead of only one-time estimation like in pyramid-based methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two representative datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RDN.",

Classical registration algorithms usually require a high computational cost for iterative optimizations. Although deep-learning-based methods have been developed for fast image registration, it is still challenging to obtain realistic continuous deformations from a moving image to a fixed image with less topological folding problem. To address this, here we present a novel diffusion-model-based image registration method, called DiffuseMorph. DiffuseMorph not only generates synthetic deformed images through reverse diffusion but also allows image registration by deformation fields. Specifically, the deformation fields are generated by the conditional score function of the deformation between the moving and fixed images, so that the registration can be performed from continuous deformation by simply scaling the latent feature of the score. Experimental results on 2D facial and 3D medical image registration tasks demonstrate that our method provides flexible deformations with topology preservation capability.",

This has important clinical applications. In this article, we propose an unsupervised end-to-end medical image registration method. In this method, the fixed image and the moving image are concatenated in series and input into the convolution neural network to obtain the feature images of different scales. In order to improve the ability of neural network to capture global and local information, we fuse feature maps of different scales. The spatial transformation network uses the deformation field to deform the moving image, so as to realize the registration of the two pairs. We validate our method in the ABIDE data set and compare it with some classic state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that our method improves the registration accuracy of image pairs.",

The techniques are particularly effective for registration problems in which one or both of the images to be registered contains significant levels of noise. A brief overview of existing deformable registration techniques is presented, and experiments using B-spline free-form deformation registration models demonstrate that ordinary deformable registration techniques fail to produce accurate results in the presence of significant levels of noise. The hierarchical multiscale image decomposition described in E. Tadmor, S. Nezzar, and L. Vese's, \"A multiscale image representation using hierarchical (BV;L2) decompositions\" (Multiscale Modeling and Simulations, 2 (2004): 4, pp. 554-579) is reviewed, and multiscale image registration algorithms are developed based on the multiscale decomposition. Accurate registration of noisy images is achieved by obtaining a hierarchical multiscale decomposition of the images and iteratively registering the resulting components. This approach enables a successful regstration of images that contain noise levels well beyond the level at which ordinary deformable registration fails. Numerous image registration experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the multiscale registration techniques.",

The proposed method can be seen as a tradeoff between the landmark and intensity driven data registration techniques. The algorithm is fast, robust and offers high registration accuracy. The algorithm enables to include complex constraints on the allowable data deformations. It is shown that some of these constraints permit to treat part of the data as rigid objects or restrict its deformation to a predefined shape. The main focus of the paper is put on the description of the elastic deformation model used in the method. The performance of this new technique is illustrated using simulated as well as real computed tomography (CT) images.",

In addition to these components, the optimization also includes one or more regularization terms such as the smoothness of the underlying deformation or restrictions based on the physical properties of organs. It is also common for most of the algorithms to take a multi\u2010resolution approach to capture large initial deformations as well as to speed up the registration process. Understanding and proper choice of such parameters are critical to a successful registration. The effects of different choices of parameters will be presented using public domain algorithms as well as commercial software. Learning objectives: 1.

Moreover, we explain why variational based methods to image registration naturally lead to large scaled and challenging optimization and hence numerical linear algebra problems.

The goal of DEFORM'06 was to bring together people from different domains having interests in deformable image registration. In response to our Call for Papers, we received 17 submissions and selected 8 for oral presentation at the workshop. In addition to the regular papers, Andrew Fitzgibbon from Microsoft Research Cambridge gave an invited talk at the workshop. The conference website including online proceedings remains open, see http://comsee.univ-bpclermont.fr/events/DEFORM06. We would like to thank the BMVC'06 co-chairs, Mike Chantler, Manuel Trucco and especially Bob Fisher for is great help in the local arrangements, Andrew Fitzgibbon, and the Programme Committee members who provided insightful reviews of the submitted papers. Special thanks go to Marc Richetin, head of the CNRS Research Federation TIMS, which sponsored the workshop. August 2006 Adrien Bartoli Nassir Navab Vincent Lepeti",

However, deep learning-based registration models have mostly relied on spatially-invariant regularization. Here, we introduce an end-to-end framework that uses neural networks to learn a spatially-varying deformation regularizer directly from data. The hyperparameter of the proposed regularizer is conditioned into the network, enabling easy tuning of the regularization strength. The proposed method is built upon a Transformer-based model, but it can be readily adapted to any network architecture. We thoroughly evaluated the proposed approach using publicly available datasets and observed a significant performance improvement while maintaining smooth deformation. The source code of this work will be made available after publication.",

However, CP extraction and correspondence establishment are still difficult under complex deformations, such as elastic deformations. To solve this problem, we present a novel approach to optimizing CP locations and simultaneously establishing the proper correspondence between these points. An expectation-maximization-like model and a refinement mechanism are proposed to achieve CP optimization as well as correspondence establishment. Experimental results for artificial and real registration tasks show that the proposed approach is robust and has good convergence behavior.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a neural computation based nonrigid registration methodology using multiple rigid transforms, in a piece-wise fashion, to model the registration process between images in a sequence. The registration methodology is a hybrid approach that combines registration without exact point correspondence via multi-object principal axes, and registration with point correspondence via polynomial transform. Neural computation is used to combine the derived individual principal axes solutions for each object in a committee machine formulation and to obtain the polynomial transform based on extracted control points using a multi layer perceptrons (MLP). Three examples are presented to demonstrate the techniques involved in the process. The first example uses four Gaussian clusters and focuses on the combination of the multiple transforms into a composite transform using finite mixture modeling techniques. The next examples present the complete process for prostate cancer registration and breast sequence analysis respectively. To verify performance, the results are compared to non-neural based implementations and other existing registration methods.",

        "abstract": "We introduce HyperMorph, a framework that facilitates efficient hyperparameter tuning in learning-based deformable image registration. Classical registration algorithms perform an iterative pair-wise optimization to compute a deformation field that aligns two images. Recent learning-based approaches leverage large image datasets to learn a function that rapidly estimates a deformation for a given image pair. In both strategies, the accuracy of the resulting spatial correspondences is strongly influenced by the choice of certain hyperparameter values. However, an effective hyperparameter search consumes substantial time and human effort as it often involves training multiple models for different fixed hyperparameter values and may lead to suboptimal registration. We propose an amortized hyperparameter learning strategy to alleviate this burden by learning the impact of hyperparameters on deformation fields. We design a meta network, or hypernetwork, that predicts the parameters of a registration network for input hyperparameters, thereby comprising a single model that generates the optimal deformation field corresponding to given hyperparameter values. This strategy enables fast, high-resolution hyperparameter search at test-time, reducing the inefficiency of traditional approaches while increasing flexibility. We also demonstrate additional benefits of HyperMorph, including enhanced robustness to model initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter values specific to a dataset, image contrast, task, or even anatomical region, all without the need to retrain models. We make our code publicly available at http://hypermorph.voxelmorph.net.",

The registration problem is to find an optimal transformation/mapping between sets of rigid or non-rigid objects and to automatically solve for correspondences. In this paper we present a comparison of two different probabilistic methods, the entropy and the growing neural gas network (GNG), as general feature-based registration algorithms. Using entropy shape modelling is performed by connecting the point sets with the highest probability of curvature information, while with GNG the points sets are connected using nearest-neighbour relationships derived from competitive hebbian learning. In order to compare performances we use different levels of shape deformation starting with a simple shape 2D MRI brain ventricles and moving to more complicated shapes like hands. Results both quantitatively and qualitatively are given for both sets.",
