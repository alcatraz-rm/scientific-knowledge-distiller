Different from rigid registration, its purpose is to find the optimal nonlinear transformation between two images and establish corresponding relationship, so as to achieve image consistency. In recent years, deformable registration methods based on deep learning have been studied a lot. Compared with traditional methods, they show great advantages in registration performance. This paper proposes an attention-based residual neural network for deformable image registration, which utilizes the U-Net encoder-decoder structure to design a convolutional neural network to predict the deformation field, and uses the residual module and attention mechanism enhances the ability of the model to extract features, and finally uses the spatial transformation function to obtain the registered image, and the entire network is trained in an unsupervised manner. We conducted experiments on the MNIST dataset and 2D brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) respectively. The experimental results show that the deformable registration network proposed in this paper has good performance and shows good results in registration accuracy.",10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c53bd3f4b873e163d27f3083dfe6408a264cc00e

Such issues may degrade the deformable image registration accuracy. This study evaluates the deformable image registration from kilovoltage to megavoltage images when using different deformation methods and assessing nasopharyngeal carcinoma patient images. Methods: The kilovoltage and the megavoltage images from the first day and the 20th fractions of the treatment day of 12 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were used to evaluate the deformable image registration application. The deformable image registration image procedures were classified into 3 groups, including kilovoltage to kilovoltage, megavoltage to megavoltage, and kilovoltage to megavoltage. Three deformable image registration methods were employed using the deformable image registration and adaptive radiotherapy software. The validation was compared by volume-based, intensity-based, and deformation field analyses. Results: The use of different deformation methods greatly affected the deformable image registration accuracy from kilovoltage to megavoltage. The asymmetric transformation with the demon method was significantly better than other methods and illustrated satisfactory value for adaptive applications. The deformable image registration accuracy from kilovoltage to megavoltage showed no significant difference from the kilovoltage to kilovoltage images when using the appropriate method of registration. Conclusions: The choice of deformation method should be considered when applying the deformable image registration from kilovoltage to megavoltage images. The deformable image registration accuracy from kilovoltage to megavoltage revealed a good agreement in terms of intensity-based, volume-based, and deformation field analyses and showed clinically useful methods for nasopharyngeal carcinoma adaptive radiotherapy in tomotherapy applications.",18,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7daef8f5108679cc7035b870b847b684938e02bb

deformable registration methods minimize sum of squared difference (SSD) as the

construct a tight upper bound of the SSD registration cost by using a fully
convolutional neural network (FCNN) in the registration pipeline. The upper
bound SSD (UB-SSD) enhances the original deformable model parameter space by
adding a heatmap output from FCNN. Next, we minimize this UB-SSD by adjusting
both the parameters of the FCNN and the parameters of the deformable model in
coordinate descent. Our coordinate descent framework is end-to-end and can work
with any deformable registration method that uses SSD. We demonstrate
experimentally that our method enhances the accuracy of deformable registration

into one coordinate system by non-linear transformation, serves as an essential
preprocessing step for neuroimaging data. Recent research on deformable image
registration is mainly focused on improving the registration accuracy using
multi-stage alignment methods, where the source image is repeatedly deformed in
stages by a same neural network until it is well-aligned with the target image.
Conventional methods for multi-stage registration can often blur the source
image as the pixel/voxel values are repeatedly interpolated from the image
generated by the previous stage. However, maintaining image quality such as
sharpness during image registration is crucial to medical data analysis. In
this paper, we study the problem of anti-blur deformable image registration and
propose a novel solution, called Anti-Blur Network (ABN), for multi-stage image
registration. Specifically, we use a pair of short-term registration and
long-term memory networks to learn the nonlinear deformations at each stage,
where the short-term registration network learns how to improve the
registration accuracy incrementally and the long-term memory network combines
all the previous deformations to allow an interpolation to perform on the raw
image directly and preserve image sharpness. Extensive experiments on both
natural and medical image datasets demonstrated that ABN can accurately
register images while preserving their sharpness. Our code and data can be
found at https://github.com/anonymous3214/ABN",34,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03277v1

Basically, the task of deformable image registration is to find the displacement field between the reference image and the moving image. Many research works have been done for deformable image registration, under the assumption that the image resolution is high enough. However, due to the limited level of current acquisition instruments, the resolution of images is not high enough usually. As low resolution images might cause large registration errors, this paper presents a new approach that performs joint super-resolution and deformable image registration. Experiments with 3D brain images show that the joint network does help to reduce the registration errors significantly.",46,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6944fc5b67eed16233e8c9dea92d8c3dcf10e7ab

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant potential in deformable registration. However, the lack of voxel-wise ground truth challenges the training of CNNs for an accurate registration. In this work, we propose a cross-modality similarity metric, based on the KL-divergence of image variables, and implement an efficient estimation method using a CNN. This estimation network, referred to as KLDivNet, can be trained unsupervisedly. We then embed the KLDivNet into a registration network to achieve the unsupervised deformable registration for multi-modality images. We employed three datasets, i.e., AAL Brain, LiTS Liver and Hospital Liver, with both the intra- and inter-modality image registration tasks for validation. Results showed that our similarity metric was effective, and the proposed registration network delivered superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",55,https://web.archive.org/web/20200321143448/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08767v2.pdf

The first part focuses on the description of input and output of deformable registration algorithms, with a brief review of conventional and most current methods. The typical applications of deformable registration are then reviewed on the basis of four practical examples. The first two sets of examples deal with the fusion of images obtained from the same patient (inter-fraction registration), with time intervals of several days between each image. The other two examples deal with the fusion of images obtained in immediate sequence (intra-fraction registration); in this case, the focus is the displacement during image acquisition or patient treatment (mainly due to respiratory movement), with time intervals in the order of magnitude of tenths of seconds. Finally, the registration of images of different patients (inter-patient registration) is also discussed. In conclusion, deformable registration has become a fundamental tool for image analysis in radiotherapy. Although extensive validation of the numerous existing methods is required before extending its clinical use, deformable registration is expected to become a standard methodology in the treatment planning systems in the near future.",58,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e9e10207d1d158c6f507fde929384ec7e79d4f7

Although numerous methods have attempted to register deformable medical images automatically, such as salient-feature-based registration (SFBR), free-form deformation (FFD), and demons, no automatic method for registration is perfect, and no generic automatic algorithm has shown to work properly for clinical applications due to the fact that the deformation field is often complex and cannot be estimated well by current automatic deformable registration methods. This paper focuses on how to revise registration results interactively for deformable image registration. We can manually revise the transformed image locally in a hierarchical multigrid manner to make the transformed image register well with the reference image. The proposed method is based on multilevel B-spline to interactively revise the deformable transformation in the overlapping region between the reference image and the transformed image. The resulting deformation controls the shape of the transformed image and produces a nice registration or improves the registration results of other registration methods. Experimental results in clinical medical images for adaptive radiotherapy demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",60,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f7e54920f4ee68687364740e062bc923842ec5d

These methods surpass conventional image registration techniques in speed but not in accuracy. Here, we present an alternative approach to leveraging neural networks for image registration. Instead of using a convolutional neural network to predict the transformation between images, we optimize a multi-layer perceptron to represent this transformation function. Using recent insights from differentiable rendering, we show how such an implicit deformable image registration (idir) model can be naturally combined with regularization terms based on standard automatic differentiation techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model on 4D chest CT registration in the DIR-LAB data set and find that a three-layer multi-layer perceptron with periodic activation functions outperforms all published deep learning-based results on this problem, without any folding and without the need for training data. The model is implemented using standard deep learning libraries and flexible enough to be extended to include different losses, regularizers, and optimization schemes.",63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3857fcd457aa50cec2b198d40800078472ef3ea

Error estimation in nonlinear medical image registration is a nontrivial problem that is important for validation of registration methods. We propose a supervised method for estimation of registration errors in nonlinear registration of three-dimensional (3-D) images. The method is based on a 3-D convolutional neural network that learns to estimate registration errors from a pair of image patches. By applying the network to patches centered around every voxel, we construct registration error maps. The network is trained using a set of representative images that have been synthetically transformed to construct a set of image pairs with known deformations. The method is evaluated on deformable registrations of inhale-exhale pairs of thoracic CT scans. Using ground truth target registration errors on manually annotated landmarks, we evaluate the method's ability to estimate local registration errors. Estimation of full domain error maps is evaluated using a gold standard approach. The two evaluation approaches show that we can train the network to robustly estimate registration errors in a predetermined range, with subvoxel accuracy. We achieved a root-mean-square deviation of 0.51 mm from gold standard registration errors and of 0.66 mm from ground truth landmark registration errors.

technique of many (semi-)automatic medical image analysis tasks. Recent studies
have shown that deep learning methods, notably convolutional neural networks
(ConvNets), can be used for image registration. Thus far training of ConvNets
for registration was supervised using predefined example registrations.
However, obtaining example registrations is not trivial. To circumvent the need
for predefined examples, and thereby to increase convenience of training
ConvNets for image registration, we propose the Deep Learning Image
Registration (DLIR) framework for \textit{unsupervised} affine and deformable
image registration. In the DLIR framework ConvNets are trained for image
registration by exploiting image similarity analogous to conventional
intensity-based image registration. After a ConvNet has been trained with the
DLIR framework, it can be used to register pairs of unseen images in one shot.
We propose flexible ConvNets designs for affine image registration and for
deformable image registration. By stacking multiple of these ConvNets into a
larger architecture, we are able to perform coarse-to-fine image registration.
We show for registration of cardiac cine MRI and registration of chest CT that
performance of the DLIR framework is comparable to conventional image
registration while being several orders of magnitude faster.",76,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06130v2

ADMIR includes three key components: an affine registration module for learning the affine transformation parameters, a deformable registration module for learning the displacement vector field, and a spatial transformer for getting the final warped image from both affine and deformable transformation parameters. To evaluate its performance, the magnetic resonance images of drug-addicted brains were used to train and test the model, and we compared it with two state-of-art methods in terms of Dice score, Hausdorff distance, and average symmetric surface distance. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed ADMIR model outperforms existing methods even with the images without pre-alignment, which suggests that the ADMIR model can be used to achieve quick medical image registration with high accuracy.

Applications of the 3D and 4D deformable registration include: (1) Inter‐subject atlas‐based image segmentation to automatically contour normal tissue regions of interest (ROI) in treatment planningCTimages; (2) Intra‐subject atlas‐based image segmentation to delineate daily ROIs by registering daily FBCT or CBCTimages to treatment planningCTimages. This method is an ideal ROI delineation method for online plan adjustments; (3) 4D deformable image registration to extract average voxel trajectories for real‐time tumor tracking and for 4D tomotherapy treatment planning; (4) Deformable fusion of 4D‐PET images, which is based on deformable registration of 4D‐CT images, to minimize motion blurring in PET images without increase of committed doses or data acquisition time. Results: The deformable image registration system was tested using clinical images. Registrations of inter‐ and intra‐subject images show acceptable results. The corresponding results are reported in our supporting document. Quantitative validation of intra‐subject atlas‐based image segmentation showed agreements with physicians' manual contours. 4D registration yields voxel trajectories smooth in both spatial and temporal spaces. Problems were noticed in the cases where the registration image pairs are intrinsically different, such as gas bubbles in rectums, or deformations are extremely large, such as empty vs. full bladders.

You Zhang,An unsupervised 2D–3D deformable registration network (2D3D-RegNet) for cone-beam CT estimation,2021-02-25 00:00:00,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,10.1088/1361-6560/abe9f6,"Acquiring CBCTs from a limited scan angle can help to reduce the imaging time, save the imaging dose, and allow continuous target localizations through arc-based treatments with high temporal resolution. However, insufficient scan angle sampling leads to severe distortions and artifacts in the reconstructed CBCT images, limiting their clinical applicability. 2D–3D deformable registration can map a prior fully-sampled CT/CBCT volume to estimate a new CBCT, based on limited-angle on-board cone-beam projections. The resulting CBCT images estimated by 2D–3D deformable registration can successfully suppress the distortions and artifacts, and reflect up-to-date patient anatomy. However, traditional iterative 2D–3D deformable registration algorithm is very computationally expensive and time-consuming, which takes hours to generate a high quality deformation vector field (DVF) and the CBCT. In this work, we developed an unsupervised, end-to-end, 2D–3D deformable registration framework using convolutional neural networks (2D3D-RegNet) to address the speed bottleneck of the conventional iterative 2D–3D deformable registration algorithm. The 2D3D-RegNet was able to solve the DVFs within 5 seconds for 90 orthogonally-arranged projections covering a combined 90° scan angle, with DVF accuracy superior to 3D–3D deformable registration, and on par with the conventional 2D–3D deformable registration algorithm. We also performed a preliminary robustness analysis of 2D3D-RegNet towards projection angular sampling frequency variations, as well as scan angle offsets. The synergy of 2D3D-RegNet with biomechanical modeling was also evaluated, and demonstrated that 2D3D-RegNet can function as a fast DVF solution core for further DVF refinement.",85,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57761102e933706a389c1e550f3010963c83fdb7

Volumetric medical image registration has important clinical significance. Traditional registration methods may be time-consuming when processing large volumetric data due to their iterative optimizations. In contrast, existing deep learning-based networks can obtain the registration quickly. However, most of them require independent rigid alignment before deformable registration; these two steps are often performed separately and cannot be end-to-end.


METHODS
We propose an end-to-end joint affine and deformable network for 3D medical image registration. The proposed network combines two deformation methods; the first one is for obtaining affine alignment, and the second one is a deformable subnet work for achieving the non-rigid registration. The parameters of the two subnetworks are shared. The global and local similarity measures are used as loss functions for the two subnetworks, respectively. Moreover, an anatomical similarity loss is devised to weakly supervise the training of the whole registration network. Finally, the trained network can perform deformable registration in one forward pass.


RESULTS
The efficacy of our network was extensively evaluated on three public brain MRI datasets including Mindboggle101, LPBA40, and IXI. Experimental results demonstrate our network consistently outperformed several state-of-the-art methods with respect to the metrics of Dice index (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD) and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD).


CONCLUSIONS
The proposed network provides accurate and robust volumetric registration without any pre-alignment requirement, which facilitates the end-to-end deformable registration.",91,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5601002c49e37878cf3fbc066d0af93f06e126a2
