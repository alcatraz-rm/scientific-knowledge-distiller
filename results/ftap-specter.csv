The first fundamental theorem of asset pricing relates the concept of No Arbitrage to the existence of a risk-neutral pricing measure and the second links market completeness with the uniquness of a pricing measure. This paper gives a brief overview of both fundamental theorems of asset pricing.",61

The risk premium is still the negative of the covariance of the excess return with the log stochastic discount factor. The risk-neutral distribution has a simple form but is a nontrivial transformation of the physical distribution.,65
