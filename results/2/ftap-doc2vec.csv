the main theorem of the paper. Here, formally unramified will be proved to be
arithmetically unramified which is defined in an evident manner and coincides
with that in algebraic number theory. Hence, formally unramified has an
arithmetic sense. At the same time, such a computation coincides with the known

"Anna Ananova,Rama Cont,Renyuan Xu",Excursion Risk,2020-11-05 14:45:58+00:00,SupportedSources.ARXIV,,"The risk and return profiles of a broad class of dynamic trading strategies,
including pairs trading and other statistical arbitrage strategies, may be
characterized in terms of excursions of the market price of a portfolio away
from a reference level. We propose a mathematical framework for the risk
analysis of such strategies, based on a description in terms of price
excursions, first in a pathwise setting, without probabilistic assumptions,
then in a Markovian setting.
  We introduce the notion of delta-excursion, defined as a path which deviates
by delta from a reference level before returning to this level. We show that
every continuous path has a unique decomposition into delta-excursions, which
is useful for the scenario analysis of dynamic trading strategies, leading to
simple expressions for the number of trades, realized profit, maximum loss and
drawdown. As delta is decreased to zero, properties of this decomposition
relate to the local time of the path.
  When the underlying asset follows a Markov process, we combine these results
with Ito's excursion theory to obtain a tractable decomposition of the process
as a concatenation of independent delta-excursions, whose distribution is
described in terms of Ito's excursion measure. We provide analytical results
for linear diffusions and give new examples of stochastic processes for
flexible and tractable modeling of excursions. Finally, we describe a
non-parametric scenario simulation method for generating paths whose excursion
properties match those observed in empirical data.",2,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02870v1

"Sebastian Perez-Salazar,Mohit Singh,Alejandro Toriello",The IID Prophet Inequality with Limited Flexibility,2022-10-11 17:26:18+00:00,SupportedSources.ARXIV,,"In online sales, sellers usually offer each potential buyer a posted price in
a take-it-or-leave fashion. Buyers can sometimes see posted prices faced by
other buyers, and changing the price frequently could be considered unfair. The
literature on posted price mechanisms and prophet inequality problems has
studied the two extremes of pricing policies, the fixed price policy and fully
dynamic pricing. The former is suboptimal in revenue but is perceived as fairer
than the latter. This work examines the middle situation, where there are at
most $k$ distinct prices over the selling horizon. Using the framework of
prophet inequalities with independent and identically distributed random
variables, we propose a new prophet inequality for strategies that use at most
$k$ thresholds. We present asymptotic results in $k$ and results for small
values of $k$. For $k=2$ prices, we show an improvement of at least $11\%$ over
the best fixed-price solution. Moreover, $k=5$ prices suffice to guarantee
almost $99\%$ of the approximation factor obtained by a fully dynamic policy
that uses an arbitrary number of prices. From a technical standpoint, we use an
infinite-dimensional linear program in our analysis; this formulation could be
of independent interest to other online selection problems.",3,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05634v2

Moreover, the distributions returns scaled by the realized standard deviations are also Gaussian. Furthermore, the realized logarithmic standard deviations and correlations all show strong dependence and appear to be well described by long-memory processes, consistent with our documentation of remarkably precise scaling laws under temporal aggregation. Our results also show that positive returns have less impact on future variances and correlations than negative returns of the same absolute magnitude, although the economic importance of this asymmetry is minor. Finally, there is strong evidence that equity volatilities and correlations move together, thus diminishing the benefits to diversification when the market is most volatile. By explicitly incorporating each of these stylized facts, our findings set the stage for improved high-dimensional volatility modeling and out-of-sample forecasting, which in turn hold promise for the development of better decision making in practical situations of risk management, portfolio allocation, and asset pricing.",12,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6649915.pdf

Moreover, when testing for stochastic dominance/efficiency of a given evaluated portfolio, our method makes it straightforward to impose a no short sales restriction on the admissible allocations to the test assets. While important in practice in certain circumstance, this is instead very hard, if not impossible, in a traditional GMM setting. In an empirical application using 51 years of data on portfolios formed sorting stocks on size and size and book-to-market, we find that, under decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) as well as more restrictive parametric specifications of the utility function, the market portfolio is stochastically dominated by the size and book to market portfolios while it compares favorably to the size portfolios.",13,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2cee25b8792328eb19bc27f2fc9f2653b5cf2824

Our first notable finding is the mechanism of reward/penalty associated with patience, as quantified by the return on assets. In regular economies where the EBITA/Assets ratio is larger than the cost of debt, starting with a trust higher than leverage results in the highest long-term return on assets (which can be seen as a proxy for economic growth). Our second main finding concerns a recommendation for the reaction of a central bank to an external shock that affects negatively the economic growth. We find that late policy intervention in the model economy results in the highest long-term return on assets and largest asset value. But this comes at the cost of suffering longer from the crisis until the intervention occurs. The phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that postponing intervention allows trust to increase first, and it is most effective to intervene when trust is high. These results derive from two fundamental assumptions underlying our model: (a) trust tends to increase when it is above leverage; (b) economic agents learn optimally to adjust debt for a given level of trust and amount of assets. Using a Markov Switching Model for the EBITA/Assets ratio, we have successfully calibrated our model to the empirical data of the return on equity of the EURO STOXX 50 for the time period 2000-2013. We find that dynamics of leverage and trust can be highly non-monotonous with curved trajectories, as a result of the nonlinear coupling between the variables.",21,https://web.archive.org/web/20200918213530/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03618v1.pdf

I document that the forecasting variables are priced so that expected excess returns are related to their conditional covariances with the forecasting variables. The variability in the covariance risk fails to explain the cross-sectional and time series variation in expected stock returns. Evidence rejects restrictions on the prices of covariance risk imposed by the model with constant volatilities. I also find that an extended model that allows time-varying conditional volatilities is misspecified.,28,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/044535d3db9e1cab69513795de3e8702a82e4370

systems is a regular surface as switching manifold, at which case there is at
least well-defined and established Filippov dynamics. However, systems with
singular switching manifolds still lack such well-established dynamics,
although present in many relevant models of phenomena where multiple switches
or multiple abrupt changes occur. At this work, we leverage a methodology that,
through blow-ups and singular perturbation, allows the extension of Filippov
dynamics to the singular case. Specifically, tridimensional systems whose
switching manifold consists of an algebraic manifold with transversal
self-intersection are considered. This configuration, known as double
discontinuity, represents systems with two switches and whose singular part
consists of a straight line, where ordinary Filippov dynamics is not directly
applicable. For the general, non-linear case, beyond defining the so-called
fundamental dynamics over the singular part, general theorems on its
qualitative behavior are provided. For the affine case, however, theorems fully
describing the fundamental dynamics are obtained. Finally, this fine-grained

Vittorio Bilò,On the Robustness of the Approximate Price of Anarchy in Generalized Congestion Games,2014-12-02 10:30:27+00:00,SupportedSources.ARXIV,,"One of the main results shown through Roughgarden's notions of smooth games
and robust price of anarchy is that, for any sum-bounded utilitarian social
function, the worst-case price of anarchy of coarse correlated equilibria
coincides with that of pure Nash equilibria in the class of weighted congestion
games with non-negative and non-decreasing latency functions and that such a
value can always be derived through the, so called, smoothness argument. We
significantly extend this result by proving that, for a variety of (even
non-sum-bounded) utilitarian and egalitarian social functions and for a broad
generalization of the class of weighted congestion games with non-negative (and
possibly decreasing) latency functions, the worst-case price of anarchy of
$\epsilon$-approximate coarse correlated equilibria still coincides with that
of $\epsilon$-approximate pure Nash equilibria, for any $\epsilon\geq 0$. As a
byproduct of our proof, it also follows that such a value can always be
determined by making use of the primal-dual method we introduced in a previous
work. It is important to note that our scenario of investigation is beyond the
scope of application of the robust price of anarchy (for as it is currently

the assumption that trading of the underlying asset does not affect the price
of that asset. This assumption can be fulfilled only in perfectly liquid
markets. Since most markets are illquid, this assumption might be too
restrictive. Thus, taking into account the price impact in option pricing is an
important issue. This issue has been dealt with, to some extent, for illiquid
markets by assuming a continuous process, mainly based on the Brownian motion.
However, the recent financial crisis and its effects on the global stock
markets have propagated the urgent need for more realistic models where the
stochastic process describing the price trajectories involves random jumps.
Nonetheless, works related to markets with jumps are scant compared to the
continuous ones. In addition, these previous studies do not deal with illiquid

anarchy to characterize the impact of demand uncertainty on the efficiency of
selfish behavior. It turns out that the price of anarchy as a function of the
maximum participation probability $p=\max_{i} p_{i}$ is a nondecreasing
function. The worst case is attained when players have the same participation

The ubiquitous anomalies of size, value, momentum, investment, profitability, short-term return reversal, and long-term return reversal, disappear after the econometrician takes into account the dynamic nature of multifactor risk premia. The prior linear empirical asset pricing models arise as special cases of this dynamic multifactor model. The main contribution of the current paper relates to the design of a workhorse model in the asset pricing literature. The previous linear empirical asset pricing models can be viewed as special cases of this more general dynamic multifactor model. This dynamic multifactor model carries important implications for equity cost estimation, corporate event assessment, financial risk management, and mutual fund performance evaluation. My dynamic analysis of multifactor risk premia from the Fama-French (2015) five-factor model proposes raising the hurdle for the conventional asset pricing tests.

prices implied a $40.1\%$ probability of survival to the age 90 for a 75-year
old male ($51.2\%$ for a female) annuitant. By the year 2013 the implied
survival probability had increased to $46.1\%$ (and $53.1\%$). The
corresponding implied life expectancy has increased (at the age of 75) from
13.09 years for males (15.08 years for females) to 14.28 years (and 15.61
years.) Although these values are implied directly from markets, they are
consistent with demographic projections. Similar to implied volatility in
option pricing, we believe that our implied survival probabilities (ISP) and
implied life expectancy (ILE) are relevant for the financial management of
assets post-retirement and very important for the optimal timing and allocation
to annuities; procrastinators are swimming against an uncertain but rather
strong longevity trend.",53,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09932v1

Abstract We study robust notions of good-deal hedging and valuation under combined uncertainty about the drifts and volatilities of asset prices. Good-deal bounds are determined by a subset of risk-neutral pricing measures such that not only opportunities for arbitrage are excluded but also deals that are too good, by restricting instantaneous Sharpe ratios. A non-dominated multiple priors approach to model uncertainty (ambiguity) leads to worst-case good-deal bounds. Corresponding hedging strategies arise as minimizers of a suitable coherent risk measure. Good-deal bounds and hedges for measurable claims are characterized by solutions to secondorder backward stochastic differential equations whose generators are non-convex in the volatility. These hedging strategies are robust with respect to uncertainty in the sense that their tracking errors satisfy a supermartingale property under all a-priori valuation measures, uniformly over all priors.

In this study, a deep learning framework is proposed to combine these three market information types with different data structures, that is, numerical economic indicators represented as scalars, media represented as textual vectors, and the influences of related firms captured by graphs. More importantly, the unique data characteristics brought by such data fusion are well addressed in the proposed learning framework. Specifically, a matrix‐based module is first proposed to fuse numerical economic data and textual media, which specifically considers the interactions of the fused features. Such fused information, along with the firm relevance represented in graphs, is further integrated by a novel self‐adaptive graph neural network that can address the dynamic merging of multilinked listed firms.

quantitative finance. When the Fourier transform of the density function is
available, Fourier-based pricing methods become very competitive compared to
alternative techniques because the integrand in the frequency space has often
higher regularity than in the physical space. However, when designing a
numerical quadrature method for most of these Fourier pricing approaches, two
key aspects affecting the numerical complexity should be carefully considered:
(i) the choice of the damping parameters that ensure integrability and control
the regularity class of the integrand and (ii) the effective treatment of the
high dimensionality of the integration problem. To address these challenges,
based on the extension of the one-dimensional Fourier valuation formula to the
multivariate case, we propose an efficient numerical method for pricing
European multi-asset options based on two complementary ideas. First, we smooth
the Fourier integrand via an optimized choice of damping parameters based on a
proposed heuristic optimization rule. Second, we use the adaptive sparse grid
quadrature based on sparsification and dimension-adaptivity techniques to
accelerate the convergence of the numerical quadrature in high dimensions.
Through an extensive numerical study on the basket and rainbow options under
the multivariate geometric Brownian motion and some multivariate L\'evy models,
we demonstrate the advantages of adaptivity and our damping parameter rule on
the numerical complexity of the quadrature methods. Moreover, we reveal that
our approach achieves substantial computational gains compared to the Monte
Carlo method for different dimensions and parameter constellations.",62,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08196v2

its service (when imagined as an excludable public good) to maximize profit,
when each user's participation adds value to the platform service by creating a
positive externality to other participants. To characterize network
externalities as a function of the number of participants, we consider
different bounded and unbounded user utility models. The bounded utility model
fits many infrastructure sharing applications with bounded network value, in
which complete coverage has a finite user valuation (e.g., WiFi or hotspot).
The unbounded utility model fits the large scale data sharing and explosion in
social media, where it is expected that the network value follows Metcalfe's or
Zipf's law. For both models, we analyze the optimal pricing schemes to select
heterogeneous users in the platform under complete and incomplete information
of users' service valuations. We propose the concept of price of information
(PoI) to characterize the profit loss due to lack of information, and present
provable PoI bounds for different utility models. We show that the PoI=2 for
the bounded utility model, meaning that just half of profit is lost, whereas
the PoI>=2 for the unbounded utility model and increases as for a less concave
utility function. We also show that the complicated differentiated pricing
scheme which is optimal under incomplete user information, can be replaced by a
single uniform price scheme that is asymptotic optimal. Finally, we extend our
pricing schemes to a two-sided market by including a new group of `pure'
service users contributing no externalities, and show that the platform may
charge zero price to the original group of users in order to attract the pure

The method works by constraining on a special finite subset of strategies, called decoupled strategies. We show how the technique can be applied to understand price formation in financial market experiments by introducing a predictive measure ΔD: the different between positive decoupled strategies (recommending to buy) and negative decoupled strategies (recommending to sell). Using ΔD we illustrate how the method can predict (at certain special times) participants' actions with a high success rate in a series of experiments",79,https://web.archive.org/web/20200507011455/https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2005/2005.02337.pdf

on Expected Utility Theory (EUT). In this paper, we consider the development of

Specifically, we consider the impact of end-user decision making on pricing and
management of radio resources in a cognitive radio enabled network when there
is uncertainty in the Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees offered by the
Service Provider (SP). Using Prospect Theory (a Nobel-Prize-winning behavioral
economic theory that captures human decision making and its deviation from
EUT), we design data pricing and channel allocation algorithms for use in
cognitive radio networks by formulating a game theoretic analysis of the
interplay between the price offerings, bandwidth allocation by the SP and the
service choices made by end-users. We show that, when the end-users
under-weight the service guarantee, they tend to reject the offer which results
in under-utilization of radio resources and revenue loss. We propose prospect
pricing, a pricing mechanism that can make the system robust to decision making

with $m \geq 2$ assets when the expected logarithmic growth (ELG) rate of
wealth is used as the performance metric. With the aid of the notion called
dominant asset, it is known that the optimal ELG level is achieved by investing
all available funds on that asset. However, such an ""all-in"" strategy is
arguably too risky to implement in practice. Motivated by this issue, we study
the case where the portfolio weights are chosen in a rather ad-hoc manner and a
buy-and-hold strategy is subsequently used. Then we show that, if the
underlying portfolio contains a dominant asset, buy and hold on that specific
asset is asymptotically log-optimal with a sublinear rate of convergence. This
result also extends to the scenario where a trader either does not have a
probabilistic model for the returns or does not trust a model obtained from
historical data. To be more specific, we show that if a market contains a
dominant asset, buy and hold a market portfolio involving nonzero weights for
each asset is asymptotically log-optimal. Additionally, this paper also
includes a conjecture regarding the property called high-frequency maximality.
That is, in the absence of transaction costs, high-frequency rebalancing is
unbeatable in the ELG sense. Support for the conjecture, involving a lemma for
a weak version of the conjecture, is provided. This conjecture, if true,
enables us to improve the log-optimality result obtained previously. Finally, a
result that indicates a way regarding an issue about when should one to
rebalance their portfolio if needed, is also provided. Examples, some involving
simulations with historical data, are also provided along the way to illustrate
