financial time series exhibit short-range correlations. This entails that the
volatility process is very rough and its autocorrelation exhibits sharp decay
at the origin. Another classic stylistic feature often assumed for the
volatility is that it is mean reverting. In this paper it is shown that the
price impact of a rapidly mean reverting rough volatility model coincides with
that associated with fast mean reverting Markov stochastic volatility models.
This reconciles the empirical observation of rough volatility paths with the
good fit of the implied volatility surface to models of fast mean reverting
Markov volatilities. Moreover, the result conforms with recent numerical
results regarding rough stochastic volatility models. It extends the scope of
models for which the asymptotic results of fast mean reverting Markov
volatilities are valid. The paper concludes with a general discussion of
fractional volatility asymptotics and their interrelation. The regimes
discussed there include fast and slow volatility factors with strong or small
volatility fluctuations and with the limits not commuting in general. The
notion of a characteristic term structure exponent is introduced, this exponent
governs the implied volatility term structure in the various asymptotic
regimes.Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1604.0010",17,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00610

The present thesis first explores the numerical implementation of rough volatility models, both to provide convergence results and to ensure a competitive implementation. Our findings conclude that fractional calculus and Hölder spaces provide the right framework to set the theoretical grounds of numerical schemes related to rough volatility models and fractional diffusions in general. In addition, we explore the use of deep learning methods to leverage the speed of numerical schemes and provide state-of-the-art calibration techniques that make rough volatility models as simple and efficient to implement as the Black-Scholes formula. The second part of the thesis explores the theoretical properties of rough volatility models regarding volatility products such as VIX and realized variance options. We explore short-time asymptotics using two different techniques: Malliavin Calculus and Large Deviations Principle. Remarkably, we find that both approaches complement each other and provide a very accurate description of the short-time implied volatility smile. Building upon these short-time asymptotics, we further provide approximation formulas for the at-the-money implied volatility and its skew.

We study the asymptotic behaviour of such models, and investigate how convolutional neural networks can be used for their calibration. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction. We begin with implied volatility, and then intro- duce a number of model classes, starting with local volatility models and ending with rough volatility models, and discuss their associated asymptotic behaviour. We also introduce the theoretical tools used to prove the main results. In Chapter 2 we study the small-time behaviour of the rough Bergomi model, introduced by Bayer, Friz, and Gatheral [BFG16]. We prove a pathwise large deviations principle for a small-noise version of the model, and use this result to establish the small-time behaviour of the rescaled log stock price process. This, in turn, allows us to characterise the small-time implied volatility behaviour of the model. Using the same theoretical framework, we are also able to establish the small-time implied volatility behaviour of the lognormal fSABR model of Akahori, Song, and Wang [ASW17]. In Chapter 3 we present small-time implied volatility asymptotics for realised variance (RV) options for a number of (rough) stochastic volatility models via a large deviations principle. We interestingly discover that these (rough) volatility models, together with others proposed in the literature, generate linear smiles around the money.

The model belongs to the class of aﬃne Volterra models. In particular, the Fourier-Laplace transform of the log returns and the square of the volatility index can be computed explicitly in terms of solutions of deterministic Riccati-Volterra equations, which can be eﬃciently approximated using a multi-factor approximation technique. We calibrate a parsimonious speciﬁcation of our model characterized by a power kernel and an exponential law for the jumps. We show that our parsimonious setup is able to simultaneously capture, with a high precision, the behavior of the implied volatility smile for both S&P 500 and VIX options. In particular, we observe that in our setting the usual shift in the implied volatility of VIX options is explained by a very low value of the power in the kernel.

However, such a modeling approach is known not to be able to reproduce some of
the financial stylized facts, including the dynamics of volatility. In the
mathematical finance community, it has therefore emerged a new paradigm, named
rough volatility modeling, that represents the volatility dynamics of financial
assets as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent very small, which
indeed produces rough paths. At the same time, prices' time series have been
shown to be multiscaling, characterized by different Hurst scaling exponents.
This paper assesses the interplay, if present, between price multiscaling and
volatility roughness, defined as the (low) Hurst exponent of the volatility
process. In particular, we perform extensive simulation experiments by using
one of the leading rough volatility models present in the literature, the rough
Bergomi model. A real data analysis is also carried out in order to test if the
rough volatility model reproduces the same relationship. We find that the model
is able to reproduce multiscaling features of the prices' time series when a
low value of the Hurst exponent is used but it fails to reproduce what the real
data say. Indeed, we find that the dependency between prices' multiscaling and
the Hurst exponent of the volatility process is diametrically opposite to what
we find in real data, namely a negative interplay between the two.",34,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10466v1

In particular, rough volatility models, where the instantaneous volatility is driven by a fractional Brownian motion, provide a more accurate fit of the power-law decay observed on volatility smiles close to maturity. This thesis is concerned with deriving the asymptotic behaviour of these two classes of stochastic volatility models using large deviations techniques, in order to understand the behaviour of the implied volatility. Indeed, when pricing options, a closed-form solution to the pricing problem is often not available. Practitioners are using implied volatility as a measure of option prices that is consistent for different options with different maturities and strike prices. As this implied volatility cannot be expressed in closed form either, finding asymptotic formulas is crucial. We therefore focus on ob- taining the asymptotic behaviour of two rough volatility models, namely a generalised version of the Stein-Stein model where the volatility starts from a random distribution and the (multi-factor) rough Bergomi model for realised variance options. We also study a particular complete model with stochas- tic volatility, which can be fitted to market data perfectly via the leverage function.

to start studying local volatility models, where the local volatility of the stock varies with
the stock price and the stock price is itself stochastic. Hence, in local volatility models,
volatility is stochastic, but only because it is a function of the stochastic stock price. This
typically produces a skew in implied volatility (known as volatility smile), which can also
be obtained by using stochastic volatility models (like, for example, the Heston stochastic
volatility model), where the constant volatility of the Black-Scholes model is replaced by
a stochastic process driven by a random factor correlated with the random factor that
drives the price of the underlying asset.
Recently, Bayer et al. in [1] have gone a step further from local and stochastic
volatility modelling, proposing rough fractional stochastic volatility (RFSV) models
stating that log-volatility behaves as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent
H less than 0.5, which is essentially a non-Markovian process with stationary but not
independent increments. As a particular case for the RFSV model, these authors proposed
the so-called rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model. In this dissertation, the rBergomi model
is implemented by using the hybrid scheme proposed by Bennedsen et al. in [3], and the
implied volatility smiles over the SPX options are estimated for different maturities.
Finally, as the model depends only on three parameters: H, η (related to increments of
log-volatility) and ρ (correlation factor), these were calibrated to market data.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",47,https://core.ac.uk/download/548718885.pdf

These authors also showed the dynamics of log volatility can be well modelled by a fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst parameter of order 0.1. In the literature, there exist various opinions as to whether the Hurst index should be less than 1/2 (short memory) or above 1/2 (long memory), depending on the particular asset class. As mentioned in Funahashi & Kijima (2017), it is well known that (i) the decrease in market volatility smile amplitude is much slower than predicted by the standard stochastic volatility models and (ii) the term structure of the at-the-money volatility skew is well approximated by a powerlaw function with an exponent close to zero.

Using at-the-money options on the Standard & Poor’s 500 index with short maturity, the authors confirm the volatility is rough and the Hurst parameter is of order 0.3, ie, slightly larger than that usually obtained from historical data. Despite the fact that rough volatility models have already been elaborated on and there exists a rich literature on the subject, due to the non-Markovian nature of the fractional Brownian motion, one can face some technical problems when it comes to derivatives pricing.

Our main result is that log-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable time scale. This leads us to adopt the fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault [16]. We call our model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H < 1/2. We demonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time series data; one application is that it enables us to obtain improved forecasts of realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not long memory in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at detecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory in data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility has been widely accepted as a stylized fact. Finally, we provide a quantitative market microstructurebased foundation for our findings, relating the roughness of volatility to high frequency trading and order splitting.",61,https://web.archive.org/web/20170818042259/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3394.pdf

Scenarios are defined by the persistence of volatility (its robustness to shocks) and the volatility of volatility. A simulation experiment generates return series using both volatility models for a range of volatility scenarios representative of that observed in real assets. Forecasts are generated from SV, GARCH and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) volatility models. SV model forecasts are only noticeably more accurate than GARCH in scenarios with very high volatility of volatility and a stochastic volatility generating process. For scenarios with medium volatility of volatility, there is little penalty for using EWMA regardless of the volatility generating process. A set of return time series selected from FX rates, equity indices, equities and commodities is used to validate the simulation-based results. Broadly speaking, the real series come from the medium volatility of volatility scenarios where EWMA forecasts are reliably accurate.

But the closer we look at volatility, the harder it seems to be to model it correctly. The constant volatility assumption of early pricing models is clearly inadequate. GARCH family models make volatility a function of the asset price process, and stochastic volatility models bring in a second stochastic factor that affects volatility movements. These approaches make sense in theory, but empirically volatility shocks seem to be too persistent to be consistent with them. A further confounding factor is that implied volatilities extracted from option prices in the market are widely thought to give more accurate predictions of future realized volatility, but don't obey any of these models exactly. In this article, Li examines a volatility model with “long memory,” meaning that it can be made to fit the slow-decay feature of market volatilities. He also introduces a much more extensive data series, with intraday observations every five minutes. Using such a dense price series, realized volatility becomes observable, and the vast number of data points allows precise estimation of model parameters. For exchange rates on the deutsche mark, the yen and the British pound, the ARFIMA (“Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average”) model is shown to give a better fit to volatility behavior than the alternative model, and it beats implied volatility substantially in the standard tests of forecasting performance.",92,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5aaa76baa4039e28081e716f0d84f53f959b139f

In the absence of analytical European option pricing methods for the model, we focus on reducing the runtime-adjusted variance of Monte Carlo implied volatilities, thereby contributing to the model's calibration by simulation. We employ a novel composition of variance reduction methods, immediately applicable to any conditionally log-normal stochastic volatility model. Assuming one targets implied volatility estimates with a given degree of confidence, thus calibration RMSE, the results we demonstrate equate to significant runtime reductions-roughly 20 times on average, across different correlation regimes.",94,https://web.archive.org/web/20200310010935/https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/bitstream/10044/1/58622/2/1708.02563v3.pdf

Inspired by recent ground-breaking work on rough volatility, which showed that models with volatility driven by fractional Brownian motion with short memory allows for better calibration of the volatility surface and more robust estimation of time series of historical volatility, we provide a characterisation of the short- and long-maturity asymptotics of the implied volatility smile. Our analysis reveals that the short-memory property precisely provides a jump-type behaviour of the smile for short maturities, thereby fixing the well-known standard inability of classical stochastic volatility models to fit the short-end of the volatility smile.",95,https://web.archive.org/web/20200903002231/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.7653v2.pdf

We show we are able to filter and forecast both volatility and volatility of volatility simultaneously in this simple setting. The volatility forecast function follows a second-order difference equation as opposed to first-order under GARCH(1,1) and RT-GARCH(1,1). Empirical studies confirm the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity in the volatility process and the standardised residuals of return are close to Gaussian under this model. We show we are able to obtain better in-sample nowcast and out-of-sample forecast of volatility.",96,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1af60c957b4f7c68991f1c0bc097a9ab53dbb3fd

"Antoine Jacquier,Patrick Roome",Black-Scholes in a CEV random environment,2017-11-28 00:00:00,SupportedSources.INTERNET_ARCHIVE,,"Classical (Itô diffusions) stochastic volatility models are not able to capture the steepness of small-maturity implied volatility smiles. Jumps, in particular exponential Lévy and affine models, which exhibit small-maturity exploding smiles, have historically been proposed to remedy this (see Tank for an overview), and more recently rough volatility models AlosLeon, Fukasawa. We suggest here a different route, randomising the Black-Scholes variance by a CEV-generated distribution, which allows us to modulate the rate of explosion (through the CEV exponent) of the implied volatility for small maturities. The range of rates includes behaviours similar to exponential Lévy models and fractional stochastic volatility models.",97,https://web.archive.org/web/20200829065055/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08082v3.pdf
