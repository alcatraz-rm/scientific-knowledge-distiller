Rough volatility connects the microstructure of financial markets with the large-scale behavior of volatility as encoded in the implied volatility surface. Rough volatility models are typically very parsimonious yet are in remarkable agreement with both econometric data and option prices. Practical applications include efficient forecasting of future integrated variance and option pricing. This mini-course will include the following topics: \u2022 Scaling properties of the time series of historical volatility \u2022 Estimation of H \u2022 Volatility forecasting \u2022 The volatility surface: Stylized facts \u2022 The rough Bergomi model \u2022 Relating historical and implied model parameters \u2022 The rough Heston model \u2022 The hybrid BSS scheme \u2022 Diamonds and the Exponentiation Theorem \u2022 Calibration of model parameters References: 1.

However, due to the non-Markovian and non-semimartingale nature of the volatility process, there is no simple way to simulate efficiently such models, which makes risk management of derivatives an intricate task. In this paper, we design tractable multi-factor stochastic volatility models approximating rough volatility models and enjoying a Markovian structure. Furthermore, we apply our procedure to the specific case of the rough Heston model. This in turn enables us to derive a numerical method for solving fractional Riccati equations appearing in the characteristic function of the log-price in this setting.",

Rough volatility connects the microstructure of financial markets with the large-scale behavior of volatility as encoded in the implied volatility surface. Rough volatility models are typically very parsimonious yet are in remarkable agreement with both econometric data and option prices. Practical applications include efficient forecasting of future integrated variance and option pricing.

As an application, we prove a pathwise large deviation principle (LDP) for a certain class of rough volatility models, which in turn describes the limiting behavior of implied volatility for short maturity under those models. First we introduce a partial rough path space and an integration map on it, and then investigate several fundamental properties including local Lipschitz continuity of the integration map from the partial rough path space to a rough path space. Second we construct a rough path lift of a rough volatility model. Fi-nally, an LDP on the partial rough path space is proved and the LDP for rough volatility then follows by the continuity of the solution map of rough di\ufb00erential equations (RDE).",

Rough volatility models also generate\na local volatility surface, via the so-called Markovian projection of the\nstochastic volatility. We complement the existing results on the implied\nvolatility by studying the asymptotic behavior of the local volatility surface\ngenerated by a class of rough stochastic volatility models, encompassing the\nrough Bergomi model. Notably, we observe that the celebrated \"1/2 skew rule\"\nlinking the short-term at-the-money skew of the implied volatility to the\nshort-term at-the-money skew of the local volatility, a consequence of the\ncelebrated \"harmonic mean formula\" of [Berestycki, Busca, and Florent, QF\n2002], is replaced by a new rule: the ratio of the at-the-money implied and\nlocal volatility skews tends to the constant 1/(H + 3/2) (as opposed to the\nconstant 1/2), where H is the regularity index of the underlying instantaneous\nvolatility process",

        "abstract": "Rough volatility models are continuous time stochastic volatility models where the volatility process is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with the Hurst parameter smaller than half, and have attracted much attention since a seminal paper titled \"Volatility is rough\" was posted on SSRN in 2014 showing that the log realized volatility time series of major stock indices have the same scaling property as such a rough fractional Brownian motion has. We however find by simulations that the impressive approach tends to suggest the same roughness irrespectively whether the volatility is actually rough or not; an overlooked estimation error of latent volatility often results in an illusive scaling property. Motivated by this preliminary finding, here we develop a statistical theory for a continuous time fractional stochastic volatility model to examine whether the Hurst parameter is indeed estimated smaller than half, that is, whether the volatility is really rough. We construct a quasi-likelihood estimator and apply it to realized volatility time series. Our quasi-likelihood is based on the error distribution of the realized volatility and a Whittle-type approximation to the auto-covariance of the log-volatility process. We prove the consistency of our estimator under high frequency asymptotics, and examine by simulations its finite sample performance. Our empirical study suggests that the volatility is indeed rough; actually it is even rougher than considered in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Rough volatility models are continuous time stochastic volatility models where the volatility process is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with the Hurst parameter smaller than half, and have attracted much attention since a seminal paper titled \u201cVolatility is rough\u201d was posted on SSRN in 2014 showing that the log realized volatility time series of major stock indices have the same scaling property as such a rough fractional Brownian motion has. We however find by simulations that the impressive approach tends to suggest the same roughness irrespectively whether the volatility is actually rough or not; an overlooked estimation error of latent volatility often results in an illusive scaling property. Motivated by this preliminary finding, here we develop a statistical theory for a continuous time fractional stochastic volatility model to examine whether the Hurst parameter is indeed estimated smaller than half, that is, whether the volatility is really rough. We construct a quasi-likelihood estimator and apply it to realized volatility time series. Our quasi-likelihood is based on the error distribution of the realized volatility and a Whittle-type approximation to the auto-covariance of the log-volatility process. We prove the consistency of our estimator under high frequency asymptotics, and examine by simulations its finite sample performance. Our empirical study suggests that the volatility is indeed rough; actually it is even rougher than considered in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Rough volatility models are known to reproduce the behavior of historical volatility data while at the same time fitting the volatility surface remarkably well, with very few parameters. However, managing the risks of derivatives under rough volatility can be intricate since the dynamics involve fractional Brownian motion. We show in this paper that surprisingly enough, explicit hedging strategies can be obtained in the case of rough Heston models. The replicating portfolios contain the underlying asset and the forward variance curve, and lead to perfect hedging (at least theoretically). From a probabilistic point of view, our study enables us to disentangle the infinite-dimensional Markovian structure associated to rough volatility models.",

        "abstract": "Recent empirical studies suggest that the volatilities associated with\nfinancial time series exhibit short-range correlations. This entails that the\nvolatility process is very rough and its autocorrelation exhibits sharp decay\nat the origin. Another classic stylistic feature often assumed for the\nvolatility is that it is mean reverting. In this paper it is shown that the\nprice impact of a rapidly mean reverting rough volatility model coincides with\nthat associated with fast mean reverting Markov stochastic volatility models.\nThis reconciles the empirical observation of rough volatility paths with the\ngood fit of the implied volatility surface to models of fast mean reverting\nMarkov volatilities. Moreover, the result conforms with recent numerical\nresults regarding rough stochastic volatility models. It extends the scope of\nmodels for which the asymptotic results of fast mean reverting Markov\nvolatilities are valid. The paper concludes with a general discussion of\nfractional volatility asymptotics and their interrelation. The regimes\ndiscussed there include fast and slow volatility factors with strong or small\nvolatility fluctuations and with the limits not commuting in general. The\nnotion of a characteristic term structure exponent is introduced, this exponent\ngoverns the implied volatility term structure in the various asymptotic\nregimes.Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1604.0010",

        "abstract": "Rough volatility models have brought a breeze of fresh air into financial modelling, which historically has been mostly tied to Markovian models. Alas, this novelty comes with a number of challenges and questions that require new techniques to be answered. The present thesis first explores the numerical implementation of rough volatility models, both to provide convergence results and to ensure a competitive implementation. Our findings conclude that fractional calculus and H\u00f6lder spaces provide the right framework to set the theoretical grounds of numerical schemes related to rough volatility models and fractional diffusions in general. In addition, we explore the use of deep learning methods to leverage the speed of numerical schemes and provide state-of-the-art calibration techniques that make rough volatility models as simple and efficient to implement as the Black-Scholes formula. The second part of the thesis explores the theoretical properties of rough volatility models regarding volatility products such as VIX and realized variance options. We explore short-time asymptotics using two different techniques: Malliavin Calculus and Large Deviations Principle. Remarkably, we find that both approaches complement each other and provide a very accurate description of the short-time implied volatility smile. Building upon these short-time asymptotics, we further provide approximation formulas for the at-the-money implied volatility and its skew. Finally, in the third part of the thesis we cross the bridge between the physical P and risk-neutral Q measures. We provide sufficient conditions for such change of measure to be well defined and explore the numerical estimation of the market risk premium process in rough volatility models.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the work of Al'os, Le \u0301on and Vives [ALV07] and Fukasawa [Fuk17], who showed that a volatility process driven by a fractional Brownian motion generates the power law at-the-money volatility skew observed in financial market data, Gatheral, Jaisson and Rosenbaum [GJR18a] spawned a class of models now known as rough volatility models. We study the asymptotic behaviour of such models, and investigate how convolutional neural networks can be used for their calibration. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction. We begin with implied volatility, and then intro- duce a number of model classes, starting with local volatility models and ending with rough volatility models, and discuss their associated asymptotic behaviour. We also introduce the theoretical tools used to prove the main results. In Chapter 2 we study the small-time behaviour of the rough Bergomi model, introduced by Bayer, Friz, and Gatheral [BFG16]. We prove a pathwise large deviations principle for a small-noise version of the model, and use this result to establish the small-time behaviour of the rescaled log stock price process. This, in turn, allows us to characterise the small-time implied volatility behaviour of the model. Using the same theoretical framework, we are also able to establish the small-time implied volatility behaviour of the lognormal fSABR model of Akahori, Song, and Wang [ASW17]. In Chapter 3 we present small-time implied volatility asymptotics for realised variance (RV) options for a number of (rough) stochastic volatility models via a large deviations principle. We interestingly discover that these (rough) volatility models, together with others proposed in the literature, generate linear smiles around the money. We provide numerical results along with efficient and robust numerical recipes to compute the rate function; the backbone of our theoretical framework. Based on our results, we develop an approximation scheme for the density of the realised variance, which in turn allows the volatility swap density to be expressed i [...]",

We concentrate our numerical analysis to pricing VIX Futures in the rough Bergomi model and compare our results to other recently suggested benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "We study an extension of the Heston stochastic volatility model that incorporates rough volatility and jump clustering phenomena. In our model, named the rough Hawkes Heston stochastic volatility model, the spot variance is a rough Hawkes-type process proportional to the intensity process of the jump component appearing in the dynamics of the spot variance itself and the log returns. The model belongs to the class of a\ufb03ne Volterra models. In particular, the Fourier-Laplace transform of the log returns and the square of the volatility index can be computed explicitly in terms of solutions of deterministic Riccati-Volterra equations, which can be e\ufb03ciently approximated using a multi-factor approximation technique. We calibrate a parsimonious speci\ufb01cation of our model characterized by a power kernel and an exponential law for the jumps. We show that our parsimonious setup is able to simultaneously capture, with a high precision, the behavior of the implied volatility smile for both S&P 500 and VIX options. In particular, we observe that in our setting the usual shift in the implied volatility of VIX options is explained by a very low value of the power in the kernel. Our \ufb01ndings demonstrate the relevance, under an a\ufb03ne framework, of rough volatility and self-exciting jumps in order to capture the joint evolution of the S&P 500 and VIX.",

This LDP holds under suitable conditions, but does not require any self-similarity assumption on the Volterra process. For this reason, we are able to apply such LDP to two notable examples of non self-similar rough volatility models: models where the volatility is given as a function of a log-modulated fractional Brownian motion [Bayer et al., Log-modulated rough stochastic volatility models. SIAM J. Financ. Math, 2021, 12(3), 1257-1284], and models where it is given as a function of a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process [Gatheral et al., Volatility is rough. Quant. Finance, 2018, 18(6), 933-949]. In both cases we derive consequences for short-maturity European option prices and implied volatility surfaces. In the fOU case we also discuss moderate deviations pricing and simulation results.",

In the\nmathematical finance community, it has therefore emerged a new paradigm, named\nrough volatility modeling, that represents the volatility dynamics of financial\nassets as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent very small, which\nindeed produces rough paths. At the same time, prices' time series have been\nshown to be multiscaling, characterized by different Hurst scaling exponents.\nThis paper assesses the interplay, if present, between price multiscaling and\nvolatility roughness, defined as the (low) Hurst exponent of the volatility\nprocess. In particular, we perform extensive simulation experiments by using\none of the leading rough volatility models present in the literature, the rough\nBergomi model. A real data analysis is also carried out in order to test if the\nrough volatility model reproduces the same relationship. We find that the model\nis able to reproduce multiscaling features of the prices' time series when a\nlow value of the Hurst exponent is used but it fails to reproduce what the real\ndata say. Indeed, we find that the dependency between prices' multiscaling and\nthe Hurst exponent of the volatility process is diametrically opposite to what\nwe find in real data, namely a negative interplay between the two.",

Our main tool is the theory of regularity structures, which we use in the form of [Bayer et al; A regularity structure for rough volatility, 2017]. In essence, we implement a Laplace method on the space of models (in the sense of Hairer), which generalizes classical works of Azencott and Ben Arous on path space and then Aida, Inahama--Kawabi on rough path space. When applied to rough volatility models, e.g. in the setting of [Forde-Zhang, Asymptotics for rough stochastic volatility models, 2017], one obtains precise asymptotic for European options which refine known large deviation asymptotics.",

        "abstract": "Rough volatility models have recently been empirically shown to provide a good fit to historical volatility time series and implied volatility smiles of SPX options. They are continuous-time stochastic volatility models, whose volatility process is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter less than half. Due to the challenge that it is neither a semimartingale nor a Markov process, there is no unified method that not only applies to all rough volatility models, but also is computationally efficient. This paper proposes a semimartingale and continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) approximation approach for the general class of rough stochastic local volatility (RSLV) models. In particular, we introduce the perturbed stochastic local volatility (PSLV) model as the semimartingale approximation for the RSLV model and establish its existence , uniqueness and Markovian representation. We propose a fast CTMC algorithm and prove its weak convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and high efficiency of the method in pricing European, barrier and American options. Comparing with existing literature, a significant reduction in the CPU time to arrive at the same level of accuracy is observed.",

This thesis is concerned with deriving the asymptotic behaviour of these two classes of stochastic volatility models using large deviations techniques, in order to understand the behaviour of the implied volatility. Indeed, when pricing options, a closed-form solution to the pricing problem is often not available. Practitioners are using implied volatility as a measure of option prices that is consistent for different options with different maturities and strike prices. As this implied volatility cannot be expressed in closed form either, finding asymptotic formulas is crucial. We therefore focus on ob- taining the asymptotic behaviour of two rough volatility models, namely a generalised version of the Stein-Stein model where the volatility starts from a random distribution and the (multi-factor) rough Bergomi model for realised variance options. We also study a particular complete model with stochas- tic volatility, which can be fitted to market data perfectly via the leverage function. In each case, we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the stock price process and the implied volatility. We produce numerical schemes to compute the implied volatility smiles.",

Tailoring the neural network pricing method of [27] to our needs, we train neural networks for the rough Heston model from [14], the rough Bergomi model from [4] as well as an extended version of the latter. As a benchmark we include also the classical Heston model from [24]. Calibrating the models across 15 years of historical SPX options prices we first and foremost document consistently superior results using rough volatility. Comparing rough Heston and rough Bergomi we also find that while the former model calibrates slightly better, the latter model produces more robust predictions. Our calibration results also illuminate a structural problem in that both of these models (on average) produces too little curvature at short expirations, too little skew at long expirations. Using an extended rough Bergomi model where the explosion rates of smile and skew are decoupled, did not resolve this problem.",

In other words, the local behavior of stochastic volatility is much more irregular than semimartingales and resembles that of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H < 0 . 5 . In this paper, we derive a consistent and asymptotically mixed normal estimator of H based on high-frequency price observations. In contrast to previous works, we work in a semiparametric setting and do not assume any a priori relationship between volatility estimators and true volatility. Furthermore, our estimator attains a rate of convergence that is known to be optimal in a minimax sense in parametric rough volatility models.",

Hence, in local volatility models,\r\nvolatility is stochastic, but only because it is a function of the stochastic stock price. This\r\ntypically produces a skew in implied volatility (known as volatility smile), which can also\r\nbe obtained by using stochastic volatility models (like, for example, the Heston stochastic\r\nvolatility model), where the constant volatility of the Black-Scholes model is replaced by\r\na stochastic process driven by a random factor correlated with the random factor that\r\ndrives the price of the underlying asset.\r\nRecently, Bayer et al. in [1] have gone a step further from local and stochastic\r\nvolatility modelling, proposing rough fractional stochastic volatility (RFSV) models\r\nstating that log-volatility behaves as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent\r\nH less than 0.5, which is essentially a non-Markovian process with stationary but not\r\nindependent increments. As a particular case for the RFSV model, these authors proposed\r\nthe so-called rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model. In this dissertation, the rBergomi model\r\nis implemented by using the hybrid scheme proposed by Bennedsen et al. in [3], and the\r\nimplied volatility smiles over the SPX options are estimated for different maturities.\r\nFinally, as the model depends only on three parameters: H, \u03b7 (related to increments of\r\nlog-volatility) and \u03c1 (correlation factor), these were calibrated to market data.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",

        "abstract": "G atheral et al (2014) discovered that historical volatility time series exhibit behaviour that is much rougher than that of a Brownian motion for a wide range of assets. These authors also showed the dynamics of log volatility can be well modelled by a fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst parameter of order 0.1. In the literature, there exist various opinions as to whether the Hurst index should be less than 1/2 (short memory) or above 1/2 (long memory), depending on the particular asset class. As mentioned in Funahashi & Kijima (2017), it is well known that (i) the decrease in market volatility smile amplitude is much slower than predicted by the standard stochastic volatility models and (ii) the term structure of the at-the-money volatility skew is well approximated by a powerlaw function with an exponent close to zero. These stylised facts cannot be captured by standard models, and while (i) has been explained using a fractional volatility model with the Hurst index H > 1=2, (ii) is proven to be satisfied by a rough volatility model with H < 1=2 under a risk-neutral measure. For more detail, see Funahashi & Kijima (2017) and the references therein. In Livieri et al (2018), the value of the Hurst exponent obtained via high-frequency volatility estimations from historical price data is revisited by studying implied volatility-based approximations of the spot volatility. Using at-the-money options on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index with short maturity, the authors confirm the volatility is rough and the Hurst parameter is of order 0.3, ie, slightly larger than that usually obtained from historical data. Despite the fact that rough volatility models have already been elaborated on and there exists a rich literature on the subject, due to the non-Markovian nature of the fractional Brownian motion, one can face some technical problems when it comes to derivatives pricing. Pricing variance swaps is evenmore complicated.Therefore, in this article, we attempt to attack the rough volatility problem using some approximation to the fractional Brownian motion, which, however, is a semi-martingale.",

This can be viewed as a more practical variant of Theorem 3.1 in Fukasawa [Short-time at-the-money skew and rough fractional volatility. Quant. Finance, 2017, 17(2), 189\u2013198] (Fukasawa [Short-time at-the-money skew and rough fractional volatility. Quant. Finance, 2017, 17(2), 189\u2013198] does not allow for jumps or a finite history and uses the somewhat opaque Muravlev representation for fractional Brownian motion), or if we turn off the rough stochastic volatility, the expansion is a variant of the main result in Mijatovic and Tankov [A new look at short-term implied volatility in asset price models with jumps. Math. Finance, 2016, 26(1), 149\u2013183] and Theorem 3.2 in Figueroa-L\u00f3pez et al. [Third-order short-time expansions for close-to-the-money option prices under the CGMY model. J. Appl. Math. Finance, 2017, 24, 547\u2013574]. The regime is directly applicable to FX options where options are typically quoted in terms of delta (.10,.25 and .50) not absolute strikes, and we also compute a new prediction formula for the Riemann-Liouville process, which allows us to express the history term for the Edgeworth expansion in a more useable form in terms of the volatility process itself. We later relax the assumption of bounded volatility, and we also compute a formal small-time expansion for implied volatility in the Rough Heston model in the same regime (without jumps) which includes an additional at-the-money, convexity and fourth order correction term, and we outline how one can go to even higher order in the three separate cases , and .

Under a general framework embracing non-Markovian and non-semimartingale models, we develop an extended path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (PHJB) equation system. A verification theorem is provided. By deriving explicit solutions to three problems, including mean-variance portfolio problem (MVP) with constant risk aversion, MVP for log-returns, and an investment/consumption problem with non-exponential discounting, we present that volatility roughness adjusts the equilibrium strategies considerably, up to 40% in certain settings. Since rough volatility models capture the near-term downside risk by fitting the volatility skews, we interpret the adjustments as a hedge for this risk.",

Despite the convoluted structure and non-Markovian property of this model, it still admits a semi-analytical pricing formula for European options, the implementation of which involves solving a fractional Riccati equation. The rough Heston-CIR model is more general, taking both the rough Heston model and the Heston-CIR model as special cases. The influence of rough volatility and stochastic interest rate is shown to be significant through numerical experiments.",

Showing the consistent outperformance of this universal LSTM relative to other asset-specific parametric models, we uncover nonparametric evidences of a universal volatility formation mechanism across assets relating past market realizations, including daily returns and volatilities, to current volatilities. A parsimonious parametric forecasting device combining the rough fractional stochastic volatility and quadratic rough Heston models with fixed parameters results in the same level of performance as the universal LSTM, which confirms the universality of the volatility formation process from a parametric perspective.",

In doing so, we relax the assumption of a constant volatility of volatility and therefore, we allow the volatility of volatility to vary over time. Our methods are exceedingly simple and far simpler than the existing ones. Using intraday prices for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 equity index, the estimates revealed strong evidence that both volatility and the volatility of volatility are stochastic. We also proceeded in a Monte Carlo simulation analysis and found that the estimates were reasonably accurate. Such evidence implies that the stochastic volatility models proposed in the literature with constant volatility of volatility may fail to approximate the discrete-time short rate dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Estimating volatility from recent high frequency data, we revisit the question of the smoothness of the volatility process. Our main result is that log-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable time scale. This leads us to adopt the fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault [16]. We call our model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H < 1/2. We demonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time series data; one application is that it enables us to obtain improved forecasts of realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not long memory in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at detecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory in data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility has been widely accepted as a stylized fact. Finally, we provide a quantitative market microstructurebased foundation for our findings, relating the roughness of volatility to high frequency trading and order splitting.",

The volatility therefore has to be rough in a viable market of the underlying asset of which the volatility skew obeys a power law.",

Unlike\r\nstandard bivariate diffusion models such as Heston (1993), these non-Markovian models with\r\nfractional volatility drivers allow to parsimoniously recover key stylized facts of market implied\r\nvolatility surfaces such as the exploding power-law behaviour of the at-the-money volatility skew\r\nas time to maturity goes to zero. Standard model calibration routines rely on the repetitive evaluation\r\nof the map from model parameters to Black-Scholes implied volatility, rendering calibration\r\nof many (rough) stochastic volatility models prohibitively expensive since there the map can often\r\nonly be approximated by costly Monte Carlo (MC) simulations (Bennedsen, Lunde & Pakkanen,\r\n2017; McCrickerd & Pakkanen, 2018; Bayer et al., 2016; Horvath, Jacquier & Muguruza, 2017).\r\nAs a remedy, we propose to combine a standard Levenberg-Marquardt calibration routine with\r\nneural network regression, replacing expensive MC simulations with cheap forward runs of a neural\r\nnetwork trained to approximate the implied volatility map. Numerical experiments confirm the\r\nhigh accuracy and speed of our approach",

We\nprove that when the first three of these stylized facts are considered within\nthe framework of our microscopic model, it behaves in the long run as a Heston\nstochastic volatility model, where leverage effect is generated. Adding the\nlast property enables us to obtain a rough Heston model in the limit,\nexhibiting both leverage effect and rough volatility. Hence we show that at\nleast part of the foundations of leverage effect and rough volatility can be\nfound in the microstructure of the asset.",

However, due to the non\u2010Markovian nature of the fractional Brownian motion, they raise new issues when it comes to derivatives pricing. Using an original link between nearly unstable Hawkes processes and fractional volatility models, we compute the characteristic function of the log\u2010price in rough Heston models. In the classical Heston model, the characteristic function is expressed in terms of the solution of a Riccati equation. Here, we show that rough Heston models exhibit quite a similar structure, the Riccati equation being replaced by a fractional Riccati equation.",

The objective here is to identify the volatility scenarios that favour either Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) or Stochastic Volatility (SV) models. Scenarios are defined by the persistence of volatility (its robustness to shocks) and the volatility of volatility. A simulation experiment generates return series using both volatility models for a range of volatility scenarios representative of that observed in real assets. Forecasts are generated from SV, GARCH and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) volatility models. SV model forecasts are only noticeably more accurate than GARCH in scenarios with very high volatility of volatility and a stochastic volatility generating process. For scenarios with medium volatility of volatility, there is little penalty for using EWMA regardless of the volatility generating process. A set of return time series selected from FX rates, equity indices, equities and commodities is used to validate the simulation-based results. Broadly speaking, the real series come from the medium volatility of volatility scenarios where EWMA forecasts are reliably accurate. The robust structure of EWMA appears to contribute to its greater forecasting accuracy than more flexible GARCH model.",

A basic question for such (non-Markovian) models concerns efficient numerical schemes. While strong rates are well understood (order $H$), we tackle here the intricate question of weak rates. Our main result asserts that the weak rate, for a reasonably large class of test function, is essentially of order $\\min \\{ 3H+\\tfrac12, 1 \\}$ where $H \\in (0,1/2]$ is the Hurst parameter of the fractional Brownian motion that underlies the rough volatility process. Interestingly, the phase transitation at $H=1/6$ is related to the correlation between the two driving factors, and thus gives additional meaning to a quantity already of central importance in stochastic volatility modelling. Our results are complemented by a lower bound which show that the obtained weak rate is indeed optimal.",

However, classical calibration and hedging techniques are difficult to apply under the rBergomi model due to the high cost caused by its non-Markovianity. This paper proposes a gated recurrent unit neural network (GRU-NN) architecture for hedging with different-regularity volatility. One advantage is that the gating network signals embedded in our architecture can control how the present input and previous memory update the current activation. These gates are updated adaptively in the learning process and thus outperform conventional deep learning techniques in a non-Markovian environment. Our numerical results also prove that the rBergomi model outperforms the other two models in hedging.",

In this paper, a new range-based volatility model was used to examine the economic value of volatility timing in a mean-variance framework. We compared its performance with a return-based dynamic volatility model in both in-sample and out-of-sample volatility timing strategies. For a risk-averse investor, it was shown that the predictable ability captured by the dynamic volatility models is economically significant, and that a range-based volatility model performs better than a return-based one.",

In such models, the log-volatility follows a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter smaller than half. This result has been established using high-frequency volatility estimations from historical price data. We revisit this finding by studying implied volatility-based approximations of the spot volatility. Using at-the-money options on the S&amp;P500 index with short maturity, we are able to confirm that volatility is rough. The Hurst parameter found here, of order 0.3, is slightly larger than that usually obtained from historical data. This is easily explained from a smoothing effect due to the remaining time to maturity of the considered options",

We introduce a non-parametric method for estimating the roughness of a function based on discrete sample, using the concept of normalized p -th variation along a sequence of partitions. We investigate the \ufb01nite sample performance of our estimator for measuring the roughness of sample paths of stochastic processes using detailed numerical experiments based on sample paths of fractional Brownian motion and other fractional processes. We then apply this method to estimate the roughness of realized volatility signals based on high-frequency observations. Detailed numerical experiments based on stochastic volatility models show that, even when the instantaneous volatility has di\ufb00usive dynamics with the same roughness as Brownian motion, the realized volatility exhibits rough behaviour corresponding to a Hurst exponent signi\ufb01cantly smaller than 0 . 5. Comparison of roughness estimates for realized and instantaneous volatility in fractional volatility models with di\ufb00erent values of Hurst exponent shows that, irrespective of the roughness of the spot volatility process, realized volatility always exhibits \u2018rough\u2019 behaviour with an apparent Hurst index (cid:98) H < 0 . 5. These results suggest that the origin of the roughness observed in realized volatility time-series lies in the microstructure noise rather than the volatility process itself.",

This property has lead to the design and analysis of various new rough stochastic volatility models. However, most of these developments have been carried out in the mono-asset case. In this work, we show that some specific multivariate rough volatility models arise naturally from microstructural properties of the joint dynamics of asset prices. To do so, we use Hawkes processes to build microscopic models that reproduce accurately high frequency cross-asset interactions and investigate their long term scaling limits. We emphasize the relevance of our approach by providing insights on the role of microscopic features such as momentum and meanreversion on the multidimensional price formation process. We in particular recover classical properties of high-dimensional stock correlation matrices.",

        "abstract": "Volatility is a critical parameter in virtually all option pricing models. But the closer we look at volatility, the harder it seems to be to model it correctly. The constant volatility assumption of early pricing models is clearly inadequate. GARCH family models make volatility a function of the asset price process, and stochastic volatility models bring in a second stochastic factor that affects volatility movements. These approaches make sense in theory, but empirically volatility shocks seem to be too persistent to be consistent with them. A further confounding factor is that implied volatilities extracted from option prices in the market are widely thought to give more accurate predictions of future realized volatility, but don't obey any of these models exactly. In this article, Li examines a volatility model with \u201clong memory,\u201d meaning that it can be made to fit the slow-decay feature of market volatilities. He also introduces a much more extensive data series, with intraday observations every five minutes. Using such a dense price series, realized volatility becomes observable, and the vast number of data points allows precise estimation of model parameters. For exchange rates on the deutsche mark, the yen and the British pound, the ARFIMA (\u201cAutoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average\u201d) model is shown to give a better fit to volatility behavior than the alternative model, and it beats implied volatility substantially in the standard tests of forecasting performance.",

In the absence of analytical European option pricing methods for the model, we focus on reducing the runtime-adjusted variance of Monte Carlo implied volatilities, thereby contributing to the model's calibration by simulation. We employ a novel composition of variance reduction methods, immediately applicable to any conditionally log-normal stochastic volatility model. Assuming one targets implied volatility estimates with a given degree of confidence, thus calibration RMSE, the results we demonstrate equate to significant runtime reductions-roughly 20 times on average, across different correlation regimes.",

The volatility forecast function follows a second-order difference equation as opposed to first-order under GARCH(1,1) and RT-GARCH(1,1). Empirical studies confirm the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity in the volatility process and the standardised residuals of return are close to Gaussian under this model. We show we are able to obtain better in-sample nowcast and out-of-sample forecast of volatility.",

        "abstract": "Classical (It\u00f4 diffusions) stochastic volatility models are not able to capture the steepness of small-maturity implied volatility smiles. Jumps, in particular exponential L\u00e9vy and affine models, which exhibit small-maturity exploding smiles, have historically been proposed to remedy this (see Tank for an overview), and more recently rough volatility models AlosLeon, Fukasawa. We suggest here a different route, randomising the Black-Scholes variance by a CEV-generated distribution, which allows us to modulate the rate of explosion (through the CEV exponent) of the implied volatility for small maturities. The range of rates includes behaviours similar to exponential L\u00e9vy models and fractional stochastic volatility models.",
