where the volatility process is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with the
Hurst parameter smaller than half, and have attracted much attention since a
seminal paper titled ""Volatility is rough"" was posted on SSRN in 2014 showing
that the log realized volatility time series of major stock indices have the
same scaling property as such a rough fractional Brownian motion has. We
however find by simulations that the impressive approach tends to suggest the
same roughness irrespectively whether the volatility is actually rough or not;
an overlooked estimation error of latent volatility often results in an
illusive scaling property. Motivated by this preliminary finding, here we
develop a statistical theory for a continuous time fractional stochastic
volatility model to examine whether the Hurst parameter is indeed estimated
smaller than half, that is, whether the volatility is really rough. We
construct a quasi-likelihood estimator and apply it to realized volatility time
series. Our quasi-likelihood is based on the error distribution of the realized
volatility and a Whittle-type approximation to the auto-covariance of the
log-volatility process. We prove the consistency of our estimator under high

Bayer, Friz und Gatheral (2016) constitute the latest evolution in option price modeling. Unlike
standard bivariate diffusion models such as Heston (1993), these non-Markovian models with
fractional volatility drivers allow to parsimoniously recover key stylized facts of market implied
volatility surfaces such as the exploding power-law behaviour of the at-the-money volatility skew
as time to maturity goes to zero. Standard model calibration routines rely on the repetitive evaluation
of the map from model parameters to Black-Scholes implied volatility, rendering calibration
of many (rough) stochastic volatility models prohibitively expensive since there the map can often
only be approximated by costly Monte Carlo (MC) simulations (Bennedsen, Lunde & Pakkanen,

financial time series exhibit short-range correlations. This entails that the
volatility process is very rough and its autocorrelation exhibits sharp decay
at the origin. Another classic stylistic feature often assumed for the
volatility is that it is mean reverting. In this paper it is shown that the
price impact of a rapidly mean reverting rough volatility model coincides with
that associated with fast mean reverting Markov stochastic volatility models.
This reconciles the empirical observation of rough volatility paths with the
good fit of the implied volatility surface to models of fast mean reverting
Markov volatilities. Moreover, the result conforms with recent numerical
results regarding rough stochastic volatility models. It extends the scope of
models for which the asymptotic results of fast mean reverting Markov
volatilities are valid. The paper concludes with a general discussion of
fractional volatility asymptotics and their interrelation. The regimes
discussed there include fast and slow volatility factors with strong or small
volatility fluctuations and with the limits not commuting in general. The
notion of a characteristic term structure exponent is introduced, this exponent
governs the implied volatility term structure in the various asymptotic
regimes.Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1604.0010",28,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00610

In such models, the log-volatility follows a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter smaller than half. This result has been established using high-frequency volatility estimations from historical price data. We revisit this finding by studying implied volatility-based approximations of the spot volatility. Using at-the-money options on the S&amp;P500 index with short maturity, we are able to confirm that volatility is rough. The Hurst parameter found here, of order 0.3, is slightly larger than that usually obtained from historical data.

"Resco San José, Iñigo",The rBergomi rough volatility model,2022-10-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,,"Mestrado Bolonha em Mathematical FinanceSimulation schemes to estimate volatility from high frequency data lead some authors
to start studying local volatility models, where the local volatility of the stock varies with
the stock price and the stock price is itself stochastic. Hence, in local volatility models,
volatility is stochastic, but only because it is a function of the stochastic stock price. This
typically produces a skew in implied volatility (known as volatility smile), which can also
be obtained by using stochastic volatility models (like, for example, the Heston stochastic
volatility model), where the constant volatility of the Black-Scholes model is replaced by
a stochastic process driven by a random factor correlated with the random factor that
drives the price of the underlying asset.
Recently, Bayer et al. in [1] have gone a step further from local and stochastic
volatility modelling, proposing rough fractional stochastic volatility (RFSV) models
stating that log-volatility behaves as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent
H less than 0.5, which is essentially a non-Markovian process with stationary but not
independent increments. As a particular case for the RFSV model, these authors proposed
the so-called rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model. In this dissertation, the rBergomi model
is implemented by using the hybrid scheme proposed by Bennedsen et al. in [3], and the
implied volatility smiles over the SPX options are estimated for different maturities.
Finally, as the model depends only on three parameters: H, η (related to increments of
log-volatility) and ρ (correlation factor), these were calibrated to market data.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",33,https://core.ac.uk/download/548718885.pdf

In contrast to popular bivariate diffusion models such as Heston, here the driving noise of volatility is modeled by a fractional Brownian motion (fBM) with scaling in the rough regime of Hurst parameter H < 1/2. A major appeal of such models lies in their ability to parsimoniously recover key stylized facts of market IV surfaces such as the exploding power-law behaviour of the ATM volatility skew near zero, a crucial feature Markovian models fail to reproduce. On the flipside, as a consequence of fBM being neither a semimartingale nor a Markov process for H not equal to 1/2, most currently prevalent numerical pricing and calibration routines do not (easily) carry over to the rough setting. This thesis addresses this problem and contributes to the existing literature as follows. In chapter 2, we sharpen the large deviations results of Forde-Zhang (2017) in a way that allows us to zoom-in around the money while maintaining full analytical tractability. More precisely, this amounts to proving higher order moderate deviations (MD) estimates, only recently introduced in the option pricing context. In particular, we derive small-time asymptotic formulae for log call prices and Black-Scholes implied volatility. This in turn allows us to push the applicability range of known ATM skew approximation formulae from CLT type log-moneyness deviations of order t^1/2 to the wider MD regime. In chapter 3, we present a novel Monte Carlo (MC) pricing scheme for rough volatility models based on a Karhunen-Loève-style approximation of White Noise. This complements theoretical results by Bayer et al. (2017). Our numerical experiments confirm a theoretical strong rate of H for a central object of interest and indicate a weak rate of 2H for the option price. In chapter 4, we introduce a novel model calibration routine for (rough) stochastic volatility models dubbed deep calibration. Standard model calibration routines rely on the [...]",35,https://web.archive.org/web/20200731050634/https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/9364/4/stemper_benjamin.pdf

In particular, rough volatility models, where the instantaneous volatility is driven by a fractional Brownian motion, provide a more accurate fit of the power-law decay observed on volatility smiles close to maturity. This thesis is concerned with deriving the asymptotic behaviour of these two classes of stochastic volatility models using large deviations techniques, in order to understand the behaviour of the implied volatility. Indeed, when pricing options, a closed-form solution to the pricing problem is often not available. Practitioners are using implied volatility as a measure of option prices that is consistent for different options with different maturities and strike prices. As this implied volatility cannot be expressed in closed form either, finding asymptotic formulas is crucial. We therefore focus on ob- taining the asymptotic behaviour of two rough volatility models, namely a generalised version of the Stein-Stein model where the volatility starts from a random distribution and the (multi-factor) rough Bergomi model for realised variance options. We also study a particular complete model with stochas- tic volatility, which can be fitted to market data perfectly via the leverage function. In each case, we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the stock price process and the implied volatility. We produce numerical schemes to compute the implied volatility smiles.",36,https://web.archive.org/web/20200917191742/https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/bitstream/10044/1/82258/1/Lacombe-C-2020-PhD-Thesis.pdf

Itkin",Cutting edge: Volatility modelling ADOL: Markovian approximation of a rough lognormal model,None,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"G atheral et al (2014) discovered that historical volatility time series exhibit behaviour that is much rougher than that of a Brownian motion for a wide range of assets. These authors also showed the dynamics of log volatility can be well modelled by a fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst parameter of order 0.1. In the literature, there exist various opinions as to whether the Hurst index should be less than 1/2 (short memory) or above 1/2 (long memory), depending on the particular asset class. As mentioned in Funahashi & Kijima (2017), it is well known that (i) the decrease in market volatility smile amplitude is much slower than predicted by the standard stochastic volatility models and (ii) the term structure of the at-the-money volatility skew is well approximated by a powerlaw function with an exponent close to zero. These stylised facts cannot be captured by standard models, and while (i) has been explained using a fractional volatility model with the Hurst index H > 1=2, (ii) is proven to be satisfied by a rough volatility model with H < 1=2 under a risk-neutral measure. For more detail, see Funahashi & Kijima (2017) and the references therein. In Livieri et al (2018), the value of the Hurst exponent obtained via high-frequency volatility estimations from historical price data is revisited by studying implied volatility-based approximations of the spot volatility. Using at-the-money options on the Standard & Poor’s 500 index with short maturity, the authors confirm the volatility is rough and the Hurst parameter is of order 0.3, ie, slightly larger than that usually obtained from historical data. Despite the fact that rough volatility models have already been elaborated on and there exists a rich literature on the subject, due to the non-Markovian nature of the fractional Brownian motion, one can face some technical problems when it comes to derivatives pricing. Pricing variance swaps is evenmore complicated.Therefore, in this article, we attempt to attack the rough volatility problem using some approximation to the fractional Brownian motion, which, however, is a semi-martingale.",37,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c2b6d4d3d0b3c8aed6a580fdf1c306d74f77992

Alas, this novelty comes with a number of challenges and questions that require new techniques to be answered. The present thesis first explores the numerical implementation of rough volatility models, both to provide convergence results and to ensure a competitive implementation. Our findings conclude that fractional calculus and Hölder spaces provide the right framework to set the theoretical grounds of numerical schemes related to rough volatility models and fractional diffusions in general. In addition, we explore the use of deep learning methods to leverage the speed of numerical schemes and provide state-of-the-art calibration techniques that make rough volatility models as simple and efficient to implement as the Black-Scholes formula. The second part of the thesis explores the theoretical properties of rough volatility models regarding volatility products such as VIX and realized variance options. We explore short-time asymptotics using two different techniques: Malliavin Calculus and Large Deviations Principle. Remarkably, we find that both approaches complement each other and provide a very accurate description of the short-time implied volatility smile. Building upon these short-time asymptotics, we further provide approximation formulas for the at-the-money implied volatility and its skew. Finally, in the third part of the thesis we cross the bridge between the physical P and risk-neutral Q measures.

We study the asymptotic behaviour of such models, and investigate how convolutional neural networks can be used for their calibration. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction. We begin with implied volatility, and then intro- duce a number of model classes, starting with local volatility models and ending with rough volatility models, and discuss their associated asymptotic behaviour. We also introduce the theoretical tools used to prove the main results. In Chapter 2 we study the small-time behaviour of the rough Bergomi model, introduced by Bayer, Friz, and Gatheral [BFG16]. We prove a pathwise large deviations principle for a small-noise version of the model, and use this result to establish the small-time behaviour of the rescaled log stock price process. This, in turn, allows us to characterise the small-time implied volatility behaviour of the model. Using the same theoretical framework, we are also able to establish the small-time implied volatility behaviour of the lognormal fSABR model of Akahori, Song, and Wang [ASW17]. In Chapter 3 we present small-time implied volatility asymptotics for realised variance (RV) options for a number of (rough) stochastic volatility models via a large deviations principle. We interestingly discover that these (rough) volatility models, together with others proposed in the literature, generate linear smiles around the money. We provide numerical results along with efficient and robust numerical recipes to compute the rate function; the backbone of our theoretical framework.

Christian Bayer and Eric Joseph Hall and Raúl Tempone,Weak error rates for option pricing under linear rough volatility,2021-12-15 00:00:00,SupportedSources.INTERNET_ARCHIVE,,"In quantitative finance, modeling the volatility structure of underlying assets is vital to pricing options. Rough stochastic volatility models, such as the rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral, Quantitative Finance 16(6), 887-904, 2016], seek to fit observed market data based on the observation that the log-realized variance behaves like a fractional Brownian motion with small Hurst parameter, H < 1/2, over reasonable timescales. Both time series of asset prices and option-derived price data indicate that H often takes values close to 0.1 or less, i.e., rougher than Brownian motion. This change improves the fit to both option prices and time series of underlying asset prices while maintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of the driving fractional Brownian motion in rough volatility models poses severe challenges for theoretical and numerical analyses and for computational practice. While the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution of the rough Bergomi and similar models, its strong rate of convergence is only H. We prove rate H + 1/2 for the weak convergence of the Euler method for the rough Stein-Stein model, which treats the volatility as a linear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion, and, surprisingly, we prove rate one for the case of quadratic payoff functions. Our proof uses Talay-Tubaro expansions and an affine Markovian representation of the underlying and is further supported by numerical experiments. These convergence results provide a first step toward deriving weak rates for the rough Bergomi model, which treats the volatility as a nonlinear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion.",41,https://web.archive.org/web/20211225055739/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01219v3.pdf

Our main result asserts that the weak rate, for a reasonably large class of test function, is essentially of order $\min \{ 3H+\tfrac12, 1 \}$ where $H \in (0,1/2]$ is the Hurst parameter of the fractional Brownian motion that underlies the rough volatility process.

We however find by simulations that the impressive approach tends to suggest the same roughness irrespectively whether the volatility is actually rough or not; an overlooked estimation error of latent volatility often results in an illusive scaling property. Motivated by this preliminary finding, here we develop a statistical theory for a continuous time fractional stochastic volatility model to examine whether the Hurst parameter is indeed estimated smaller than half, that is, whether the volatility is really rough. We construct a quasi-likelihood estimator and apply it to realized volatility time series. Our quasi-likelihood is based on the error distribution of the realized volatility and a Whittle-type approximation to the auto-covariance of the log-volatility process. We prove the consistency of our estimator under high frequency asymptotics, and examine by simulations its finite sample performance. Our empirical study suggests that the volatility is indeed rough; actually it is even rougher than considered in the literature.",70,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6bc6b4679530c053e7a26ed3a4467dcd65fd5bcd

On montre la validite d’une formule similaire dans le cas du modele rough Heston, ou l’equation de Riccati est remplacee par sa version fractionnaire.

,Weak,2020-02-07 00:00:00,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,10.32388/uv2lhl,". In quantitative ﬁnance, modeling the volatility structure of underlying assets is vital to pricing options. Rough stochastic volatility models, such as the rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral, Quantitative Finance 16(6), 887-904, 2016], seek to ﬁt observed market data based on the observation that the log-realized variance behaves like a fractional Brownian motion with small Hurst parameter, H < 1 / 2, over reasonable timescales. Both time series of asset prices and option-derived price data indicate that H often takes values close to 0 . 1 or less, i.e., rougher than Brownian motion. This change improves the ﬁt to both option prices and time series of underlying asset prices while maintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of the driving fractional Brownian motion in rough volatility models poses severe challenges for theoretical and numerical analyses and for computational practice. While the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution of the rough Bergomi and similar models, its strong rate of convergence is only H . We prove rate H + 1 / 2 for the weak convergence of the Euler method for the rough Stein–Stein model, which treats the volatility as a linear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion, and, surprisingly, we prove rate one for the case of quadratic payoﬀ functions. Indeed, the problem of weak convergence for rough volatility models is very subtle; we provide examples demonstrating the rate of convergence for payoﬀ functions that are well approximated by second-order polynomials, as weighted by the law of the fractional Brownian motion, may be hard to distinguish from rate one empirically. Our proof uses Talay–Tubaro expansions and an aﬃne Markovian representation of the underlying and is further supported by numerical experiments. These convergence results provide a ﬁrst step toward deriving weak rates for the rough Bergomi model, which treats the volatility as a nonlinear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion.",84,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1bf24ac4c4a1ab8dd2fd52cdf8b4975697aadcfb

"Antoine Jacquier,Aitor Muguruza,Alexandre Pannier",Rough multifactor volatility for SPX and VIX options,2021-12-28 22:12:10+00:00,SupportedSources.ARXIV,,"We provide explicit small-time formulae for the at-the-money implied
volatility, skew and curvature in a large class of models, including rough
volatility models and their multi-factor versions. Our general setup
encompasses both European options on a stock and VIX options, thereby providing
new insights on their joint calibration. The tools used are essentially based
on Malliavin calculus for Gaussian processes. We develop a detailed theoretical
and numerical analysis of the two-factor rough Bergomi model and provide
insights on the interplay between the different parameters for joint SPX-VIX
smile calibration.",94,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.14310v1

"Jingtang Ma,Haofei Wu",A fast algorithm for simulation of rough volatility models,2021-10-14 00:00:00,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,10.1080/14697688.2021.1970213,"A rough volatility model contains a stochastic Volterra integral with a weakly singular kernel. The classical Euler-Maruyama algorithm is not very efficient for simulating this kind of model because one needs to keep records of all the past path-values and thus the computational complexity is too large. This paper develops a fast two-step iteration algorithm using an approximation of the weakly singular kernel with a sum of exponential functions. Compared to the Euler-Maruyama algorithm, the complexity of the fast algorithm is reduced from to or for simulating one path, where N is the number of time steps. Further, the fast algorithm is developed to simulate rough Heston models with (or without) regime switching, and multi-factor approximation algorithms are also studied and compared. The convergence rates of the Euler-Maruyama algorithm and the fast algorithm are proved. A number of numerical examples are carried out to confirm the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",95,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2977051d71bcda59656686f01b88d519aed3c01a
"Carlo Bellingeri,Peter K. Friz,Máté Gerencsér",Singular paths spaces and applications,2021-09-03 00:00:00,SupportedSources.INTERNET_ARCHIVE,,"Motivated by recent applications in rough volatility and regularity structures, notably the notion of singular modelled distribution, we study paths, rough paths and related objects with a quantified singularity at zero. In a pure path setting this allows us to leverage on existing SLE Besov estimates to see that SLE traces takes values in a singular Hölder space, which quantifies a well-known boundary effect in the regime κ < 1. We then consider the integration theory against singular rough paths and some extensions thereof. This gives a method to reconcile, from a regularity structure point of view, different singular kernels used to construct (fractional) rough volatility models and an effective reduction to the stationary case which is crucial to apply general renormalisation methods.",96,https://web.archive.org/web/20210908072042/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03352v3.pdf

Friz,Jim Gatheral",Pricing Under Rough Volatility,2015-01-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.INTERNET_ARCHIVE,10.2139/ssrn.2554754,"From an analysis of the time series of volatility using recent high frequency data, Gatheral, Jaisson and Rosenbaum [SSRN 2509457, 2014] previously showed that log-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable time scale. The resulting Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility (RFSV) model is remarkably consistent with financial time series data. We now show how the RFSV model can be used to price claims on both the underlying and integrated volatility. We analyze in detail a simple case of this model, the rBergomi model. In particular, we find that the rBergomi model fits the SPX volatility markedly better than conventional Markovian stochastic volatility models, and with fewer parameters. Finally, we show that actual SPX variance swap curves seem to be consistent with model forecasts, with particular dramatic examples from the weekend of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Flash Crash.",98,https://web.archive.org/web/20170808025638/http://wias-berlin.de/preprint/2071/wias_preprints_2071.pdf

Numerical simulations suggest that the latter is a promising alternative to classical Monte Carlo simulations.",99,https://web.archive.org/web/20230106011824/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02551v3.pdf
