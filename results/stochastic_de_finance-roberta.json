        "abstract": "Financial systems are rich in interactions amenable to description by stochastic control theory. Optimal stochastic control theory is an elegant mathematical framework in which a controller, profitably alters the dynamics of a stochastic system by exercising costly control inputs. If the system includes more than one agent, the appropriate modelling framework is stochastic differential game theory \u2014 a multiplayer generalisation of stochastic control theory. There are numerous environments in which financial agents incur fixed minimal costs when adjusting their investment positions; trading environments with transaction costs and real options pricing are important examples. The presence of fixed minimal adjustment costs produces adjustment stickiness as agents now enact their investment adjustments over a sequence of discrete points. Despite the fundamental relevance of adjustment stickiness within economic theory, in stochastic differential game theory, the set of players\u2019 modifications to the system dynamics is mainly restricted to a continuous class of controls. Under this assumption, players modify their positions through infinitesimally fine adjustments over the problem horizon. This renders such models unsuitable for modelling systems with fixed minimal adjustment costs. To this end, we present a detailed study of strategic interactions with fixed minimal adjustment costs. We perform a comprehensive study of a new stochastic differential game of impulse control and stopping on a jump-diffusion process and, conduct a detailed investigation of two-player impulse control stochastic differential games. We establish the existence of a value of the games and show that the value is a unique (viscosity) solution to a double obstacle problem which is characterised in terms of a solution to a non-linear partial differential equation (PDE). The study is contextualised within two new models of investment that tackle a dynamic duopoly investment problem and an optimal liquidity control and lifetime ruin problem. It is then shown that each optimal investment strategy can be recovered from the equilibrium strategies of the corresponding stochastic differential game. Lastly, we introduce a dynamic principal-agent model with a self-interested agent that faces minimally bounded adjustment costs. For this setting, we show for the first time that the principal can sufficiently distort that agent\u2019s preferences so that the agent finds it optimal to execute policies that maximise the principal\u2019s payoff in the presence of fixed minimal costs",

Uniqueness of polynomial diffusions is\nestablished via moment determinacy in combination with pathwise uniqueness.\nExistence boils down to a stochastic invariance problem that we solve for\nsemialgebraic state spaces. Examples include the unit ball, the product of the\nunit cube and nonnegative orthant, and the unit simplex.Comment: This article is forthcoming in Finance and Stochastic",

Moreover, the Feynman-Kac formula and the related partial differential integral equations provide an analogue of the famous Black-Scholes partial differential equation and thus can be used for the purpose of option pricing in a multidimensional Levy market.",

There is an interplay between stochastic control and mathematics of finance. On the one hand stochastic control is a powerful tool to study financial problems. On the other hand financial applications have stimulated development in several research subareas of stochastic control in the last two decades. We start with pricing of financial derivatives and modeling of asset prices, studying the conditions for the absence of arbitrage. Then we consider pricing of defaultable contingent claims. Investments in bonds lead us to the term structure modeling problems. Special attention is devoted to historical static portfolio analysis called Markowitz theory. We also briefly sketch dynamic portfolio problems using viscosity solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, martingale-convex analysis method or stochastic maximum principle together with backward stochastic differential equation. Finally, long time portfolio analysis for both risk neutral and risk sensitive functionals is introduced.",

We establish the desirable property of the uniqueness of solution to the equation and, since the specialized model is complete, we can consistently price any contingent claim.",

For American options an\neasy-to-implement operator splitting method is described for the resulting\nlinear complementarity problems.\n  Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the actual stability and\nconvergence of the splitting schemes.

        "abstract": "Motivated by liquidity risk in mathematical finance, D. Lacker introduced\nconcentration inequalities for risk measures, i.e. upper bounds on the\n\\emph{liquidity risk profile} of a financial loss. We derive these inequalities\nin the case of time-consistent dynamic risk measures when the filtration is\nassumed to carry a Brownian motion. The theory of backward stochastic\ndifferential equations (BSDEs) and their dual formulation plays a crucial role\nin our analysis. Natural by-products of concentration of risk measures are a\ndescription of the tail behavior of the financial loss and transport-type\ninequalities in terms of the generator of the BSDE, which in the present case\ncan grow arbitrarily fast.",

This paper applies uncertain differential equation to the study of the evolution of interest rate and stock price separately. Based on actual observations, we estimate the parameters in uncertain differential equation with the method of moments. Using the introduced interest rate and stock models, we price European options and compare the results with actual observations. Finally, a paradox of the stochastic financial model is stated.",

A comprehensive Discrete Difference Equation (DDE) and a continuous Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) are derived and proved for the GTP. This allows fund managers and traders the ability to better stress test the impact of volatility to reduce risk and generate positive returns. These theorems are then simulated to complement the theoretical models with charts. Not only does this research extend a rich mathematical problem that can be further researched in its own right, but it also extends the applications into the above areas of finance.",

The solutions will be continuous stochastic processes that represent diffusive dynamics, a common modeling assumption for financial systems. We include a review of fundamental concepts, a description of elementary numerical methods and the concepts of convergence and order for stochastic differential equation solvers. In the remainder of the chapter we describe applications of SDE solvers to Monte-Carlo sampling for financial pricing of derivatives. Monte-Carlo simulation can be computationally inefficient in its basic form, and so we explore some common methods for fostering efficiency by variance reduction and the use of quasi-random numbers. In addition, we briefly discuss the extension of SDE solvers to coupled systems driven by correlated noise, which is applicable to multiple asset markets.",

Under a jump diffusion stochastic model for the underlying asset, a derivation of the FST method is presented to solve the corresponding PIDE. Illustration of the solution method is provided for valuing singleand multi-asset European options under jump diffusion models. The valuation of a Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) variable annuity is formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem. We show how the payment of incentive fees inherent in a hedge fund manager\u2019s compensation can be formulated as a path-dependent contingent claim. The financial pricing problems are numerically evaluated using the FST method and results are discussed qualitatively.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates an optimal investment strategy of DC pension plan in a stochastic interest rate and stochastic volatility framework. We apply an affine model including the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and the Vasicek mode to characterize the interest rate while the stock price is given by the Heston's stochastic volatility (SV) model. The pension manager can invest in cash, bond and stock in the financial market. Thus, the wealth of the pension fund is influenced by the financial risks in the market and the stochastic contribution from fund participant. The goal of the fund manager is, coping with the contribution rate, to maximize the expectation of the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility of the terminal value of the pension fund over a guarantee which serves as an annuity after retirement. We first transform the problem into a single investment problem, then derive explicit solution via stochastic programming method. Finally, numerical analysis is given to show the impact of financial parameters on the optimal strategies. Submission Classifications: IE53, IE13, IB13, IE12. JEL Classifications: C61,G11, G32.
