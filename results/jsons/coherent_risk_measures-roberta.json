One result, for instance, is that this index is infinite for distributions that are symmetric around 0.",

A detailed discussion of this can be found in two papers by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber and Heath, ADEH1 and ADEH2. It will not be repeated here. We will rather concentrate on the mathematics behind the concept of coherent risk measures. They were introduced in the two mentioned papers and the mathematical theory was further developped in Delbaen (1999), D2. Further use of coherent risk measures can be found in the papers (and their references) by Jaschke, Ja and JaK, Tasche, AT and F\u00f6llmer-Schied, FS. The reader should consult the cited web-sites to find several papers dealing with this subject. The paper by F\u00f6llmer and Schied introduces a generalisation of coherent risk measures.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that the widely used risk measures standard deviation and value at risk do not always reflect risk preferences accurately. To overcome these problems in risk measurement a class of coherent risk measures has been proposed. We introduce the idea behind these measures and provide an overview of suggested coherent risk measures. Finally it is shown where the limitations of such measures in practical applications are and how regulatory bodies responded to their introduction in the literature. We find that most contributions on coherent risk measurement come from the actuarial sciences and propagate a widening of the discussion among researchers and practitioners in other industries.",

An incomplete market and one period of uncertainty (0;T) are considered. A supervisor that has to decide whether the future value of a held position is acceptable or not. The values in T of positions are represented by a.s. bounded random variables on a probability space (-; F;P). A measure of risk is simply a mapping 1\u20442 : L1 ! R. A position is acceptable to the supervisor if 1\u20442 (X) \u00b7 0, unacceptable otherwise. Delbaen (2000) gives the following characterization of coherent risk measure (with the Fatou property): A measure of risk 1\u20442 : L1 ! R is coherent i\u00a4 there exists an L1 (P)-closed, convex set P3\u20444 of probability measures, all of them being absolutely continuous with respect to P, such that",

We introduce the notion of coherent risk measure defined on an arbitrary set of risks, showing that it can be considered a special case of coherent upper prevision. We also prove that our definition generalizes the notion of coherence for risk measures defined on a linear space of random numbers, given in literature. We also show that Value-at-Risk does not necessarily satisfy a weaker notion of coherence called \u2018avoiding sure loss\u2019 (ASL), and discuss both sufficient conditions for VaR to avoid sure loss and ways of modifying VaR into a coherent risk measure.",

In this space, the concept of \u201cRisk Aversion Function\u201d \u03c6 naturally arises as the spectral representation of each risk measure in a space of functions of confidence level probabilities. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on \u03c6 for M\u03c6 to be a coherent measure. We find in this way a simple interpretation of the concept of coherence and a way to map any rational investor\u2019s subjective risk aversion onto a coherent measure and vice\u2013versa. We also provide for these measures their discrete versions M (N) \u03c6 acting on finite sets of N independent realizations of a r.v. which are not only shown to be coherent measures for any fixed N , but also consistent estimators of M\u03c6 for large N . Finally, we find in our results some interesting and not yet fully investigated relationships with certain results known in insurance mathematical literature.",

One result, for instance, is that this Index is infinite for distributions that are symmetric around 0.",

We introduce the notion of coherent risk measure defined on an arbitrary set of risks, showing that it can be considered a special case of coherent upper prevision. We also prove that our definition generalizes the notion of coherence for risk measures defined on a linear space of random numbers, given in literature. Consistency properties of Value-at-Risk (VaR), currently one of the most used risk measures, are investigated too, showing that it does not necessarily satisfy a weaker notion of consistency called 'avoiding sure loss'. We introduce sufficient conditions for VaR to avoid sure loss and to be coherent. Finally we discuss ways of modifying incoherent risk measures into coherent ones.",

We show that this definition is a convenient extension of the real-valued risk measures introduced by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber and Heath (1998). We then discuss the aggregation issue, i.e. the passage from IR d \u2212valued random portfolio to IR n \u2212valued measure of risk. Necessary and sufficient conditions of coherent aggregation are provided.",

In this space, the concept of \u201cRisk Aversion Function\u201d \u03c6 naturally arises as the spectral representation of each risk measure in a space of functions of confidence level probabilities. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on \u03c6 for M\u03c6 to be a coherent measure. We find in this way a simple interpretation of the concept of coherence and a way to map any rational investor\u2019s subjective risk aversion onto a coherent measure and vice\u2014versa. We also provide for these measures their discrete versions M (N) \u03c6 acting on finite sets of N independent realizations of a r.v. which are not only shown to be coherent measures for any fixed N , but also consistent estimators of M\u03c6 for large N .",

For every set B of B with positive and finite Hausdorff outer measure in its Hausdorff dimension, a coherent conditional measure of risk is defined as the Choquet integral with respect to Hausdorff outer measure. Two risks are defined to be s-independent if the atoms of the classes generated by their weak upper level sets are s-independent. The given notion permits to capture dependence between risks that are stochastically independent according to the axiomatic definition. Two risks which are surjective and injective are proven to be s-dependent and a sufficient condition is given such that s-independent simple risks satisfy the factorization property of their joint coherent measures of risk.",

        "abstract": "Coherency is becoming a necessary feature for any risk measure, and now is an acceptable tool in risk management to assess the risk measures. For example, recent studies have strongly criticised VaR-based models for not providing a coherent risk measure. Because of such acceptance, it is important to improve the efficiency of the touchstone for evaluating risk measures in order to achieve a fairer assessment. This is just the challenge that this paper seeks to address. This goal is achieved on the one hand by doing some simplifications in axioms of coherency without losing their major financial points, and on the other hand by removing the paradox between two of the axioms. The new concept is called 'sensible coherency', and the risk measure that satisfies the four new simplified and corrected axioms will be 'sensibly coherent'. Finally, the new axioms are applied to a particular type of lower partial moments as a case study. OPSOMMING Koherensie word 'n noodsaaklike kenmerk van enige risikomaatstaf en is nou 'n aanvaarbare gereedskapstuk in die beoordeling van risikomaatstawwe. Die doel van hierdie artikel word bereik deur enersyds die aksiomas van koherensie te vereenvoudig en andersyds die paradoks tussen die aksiomas te verwyder. Die resultaat word \"sinvolle koherensie\" genoem.",

We give necessary and sufficient conditions on / for M / to be a coherent measure. We find in this way a simple interpretation of the concept of coherence and a way to map any rational investor's subjective risk aversion onto a coherent measure and vice-versa. We also provide for these measures their discrete versions M \u00f0N \u00de / acting on finite sets of N independent realizations of a r.v. which are not only shown to be coherent measures for any fixed N, but also consistent estimators of M / for large N.",

        "abstract": "The conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) has gained growing popularity in financial risk management due to the coherence property and tractability in its optimization. However, optimal solutions to the CVaR minimization are highly susceptible to estimation error of the risk measure because the estimate depends only on a small portion of sampled scenarios. The same is equally true of the other coherent measures. In this paper, by employing robust optimization modelling for minimizing coherent risk measures, we present a simple and practical way for making the solution robust over a certain range of estimation errors. More specifically, we show that a worst-case coherent risk minimization leads to a penalized minimization of the empirical risk estimate. The worst-case risk measure developed in this paper is different from the distributionally worst-case CVaR in Zhu and Fukushima's work of 2009, but these two worst-case risk measures can be simultaneously minimized. Additionally, inspired by Konno, Waki and Yuuki's work of 2002, we examine the use of factor models in coherent risk minimization. We see that, in general, factor model-based coherent risk minimization along the lines of that pursued by Goldfarb and Iyengar in 2003 becomes computationally intractable. Therefore, we apply a simplified version to the factor model-based CVaR minimization, and see that it improves on the performance, achieving better CVaR, turnover, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio than the empirical CVaR minimization and market benchmarks.",

We also provide for these measures\ntheir discrete versions M_phi^N acting on finite sets of N independent\nrealizations of a r.v. which are not only shown to be coherent measures for any\nfixed N, but also consistent estimators of M_phi for large N.

        "abstract": "We propose a new procedure for the risk measurement of large portfolios. It\nemploys the following objects as the building blocks: - coherent risk measures\nintroduced by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath; - factor risk measures\nintroduced in this paper, which assess the risks driven by particular factors\nlike the price of oil, S&P500 index, or the credit spread; - risk contributions\nand factor risk contributions, which provide a coherent alternative to the\nsensitivity coefficients.\n  We also propose two particular classes of coherent risk measures called Alpha\nV@R and Beta V@R, for which all the objects described above admit an extremely\nsimple empirical estimation procedure. This procedure uses no model assumptions\non the structure of the price evolution.\n  Moreover, we consider the problem of the risk management on a firm's level.\nIt is shown that if the risk limits are imposed on the risk contributions of\nthe desks to the overall risk of the firm (rather than on their outstanding\nrisks) and the desks are allowed to trade these limits within a firm, then the\ndesks automatically find the globally optimal portfolio",

Particular attention is devoted to the choice of a convenient risk space. We provide dual characterization results, we study different notions of time consistency and we give examples of vector-valued risk measure processes.",
