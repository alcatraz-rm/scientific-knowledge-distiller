Our main tool is the theory of regularity structures, which we use in the form of [Bayer et al; A regularity structure for rough volatility, 2017]. In essence, we implement a Laplace method on the space of models (in the sense of Hairer), which generalizes classical works of Azencott and Ben Arous on path space and then Aida, Inahama--Kawabi on rough path space. When applied to rough volatility models, e.g. in the setting of [Forde-Zhang, Asymptotics for rough stochastic volatility models, 2017], one obtains precise asymptotic for European options which refine known large deviation asymptotics.",

        "abstract": "Rough volatility models are continuous time stochastic volatility models\nwhere the volatility process is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with the\nHurst parameter smaller than half, and have attracted much attention since a\nseminal paper titled \"Volatility is rough\" was posted on SSRN in 2014 showing\nthat the log realized volatility time series of major stock indices have the\nsame scaling property as such a rough fractional Brownian motion has. We\nhowever find by simulations that the impressive approach tends to suggest the\nsame roughness irrespectively whether the volatility is actually rough or not;\nan overlooked estimation error of latent volatility often results in an\nillusive scaling property. Motivated by this preliminary finding, here we\ndevelop a statistical theory for a continuous time fractional stochastic\nvolatility model to examine whether the Hurst parameter is indeed estimated\nsmaller than half, that is, whether the volatility is really rough. We\nconstruct a quasi-likelihood estimator and apply it to realized volatility time\nseries. Our quasi-likelihood is based on the error distribution of the realized\nvolatility and a Whittle-type approximation to the auto-covariance of the\nlog-volatility process. We prove the consistency of our estimator under high\nfrequency asymptotics, and examine by simulations its finite sample\nperformance. Our empirical study suggests that the volatility is indeed rough;\nactually it is even rougher than considered in the literature.",

Unlike\r\nstandard bivariate diffusion models such as Heston (1993), these non-Markovian models with\r\nfractional volatility drivers allow to parsimoniously recover key stylized facts of market implied\r\nvolatility surfaces such as the exploding power-law behaviour of the at-the-money volatility skew\r\nas time to maturity goes to zero. Standard model calibration routines rely on the repetitive evaluation\r\nof the map from model parameters to Black-Scholes implied volatility, rendering calibration\r\nof many (rough) stochastic volatility models prohibitively expensive since there the map can often\r\nonly be approximated by costly Monte Carlo (MC) simulations (Bennedsen, Lunde & Pakkanen,\r\n2017; McCrickerd & Pakkanen, 2018; Bayer et al., 2016; Horvath, Jacquier & Muguruza, 2017).\r\nAs a remedy, we propose to combine a standard Levenberg-Marquardt calibration routine with\r\nneural network regression, replacing expensive MC simulations with cheap forward runs of a neural\r\nnetwork trained to approximate the implied volatility map. Numerical experiments confirm the\r\nhigh accuracy and speed of our approach",

Tailoring the neural network pricing method of [27] to our needs, we train neural networks for the rough Heston model from [14], the rough Bergomi model from [4] as well as an extended version of the latter. As a benchmark we include also the classical Heston model from [24]. Calibrating the models across 15 years of historical SPX options prices we first and foremost document consistently superior results using rough volatility. Comparing rough Heston and rough Bergomi we also find that while the former model calibrates slightly better, the latter model produces more robust predictions. Our calibration results also illuminate a structural problem in that both of these models (on average) produces too little curvature at short expirations, too little skew at long expirations. Using an extended rough Bergomi model where the explosion rates of smile and skew are decoupled, did not resolve this problem.",

        "abstract": "Recent empirical studies suggest that the volatilities associated with\nfinancial time series exhibit short-range correlations. This entails that the\nvolatility process is very rough and its autocorrelation exhibits sharp decay\nat the origin. Another classic stylistic feature often assumed for the\nvolatility is that it is mean reverting. In this paper it is shown that the\nprice impact of a rapidly mean reverting rough volatility model coincides with\nthat associated with fast mean reverting Markov stochastic volatility models.\nThis reconciles the empirical observation of rough volatility paths with the\ngood fit of the implied volatility surface to models of fast mean reverting\nMarkov volatilities. Moreover, the result conforms with recent numerical\nresults regarding rough stochastic volatility models. It extends the scope of\nmodels for which the asymptotic results of fast mean reverting Markov\nvolatilities are valid. The paper concludes with a general discussion of\nfractional volatility asymptotics and their interrelation. The regimes\ndiscussed there include fast and slow volatility factors with strong or small\nvolatility fluctuations and with the limits not commuting in general. The\nnotion of a characteristic term structure exponent is introduced, this exponent\ngoverns the implied volatility term structure in the various asymptotic\nregimes.Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1604.0010",

        "abstract": "It has been recently shown that spot volatilities can be closely modeled by rough stochastic volatility-type dynamics. In such models, the log-volatility follows a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter smaller than half. This result has been established using high-frequency volatility estimations from historical price data. We revisit this finding by studying implied volatility-based approximations of the spot volatility. Using at-the-money options on the S&amp;P500 index with short maturity, we are able to confirm that volatility is rough. The Hurst parameter found here, of order 0.3, is slightly larger than that usually obtained from historical data. This is easily explained from a smoothing effect due to the remaining time to maturity of the considered options",

        "abstract": "Mestrado Bolonha em Mathematical FinanceSimulation schemes to estimate volatility from high frequency data lead some authors\r\nto start studying local volatility models, where the local volatility of the stock varies with\r\nthe stock price and the stock price is itself stochastic. Hence, in local volatility models,\r\nvolatility is stochastic, but only because it is a function of the stochastic stock price. This\r\ntypically produces a skew in implied volatility (known as volatility smile), which can also\r\nbe obtained by using stochastic volatility models (like, for example, the Heston stochastic\r\nvolatility model), where the constant volatility of the Black-Scholes model is replaced by\r\na stochastic process driven by a random factor correlated with the random factor that\r\ndrives the price of the underlying asset.\r\nRecently, Bayer et al. in [1] have gone a step further from local and stochastic\r\nvolatility modelling, proposing rough fractional stochastic volatility (RFSV) models\r\nstating that log-volatility behaves as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent\r\nH less than 0.5, which is essentially a non-Markovian process with stationary but not\r\nindependent increments. As a particular case for the RFSV model, these authors proposed\r\nthe so-called rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model. In this dissertation, the rBergomi model\r\nis implemented by using the hybrid scheme proposed by Bennedsen et al. in [3], and the\r\nimplied volatility smiles over the SPX options are estimated for different maturities.\r\nFinally, as the model depends only on three parameters: H, \u03b7 (related to increments of\r\nlog-volatility) and \u03c1 (correlation factor), these were calibrated to market data.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",

        "abstract": "So-called rough stochastic volatility models constitute the latest advancement in option price modeling. In contrast to popular bivariate diffusion models such as Heston, here the driving noise of volatility is modeled by a fractional Brownian motion (fBM) with scaling in the rough regime of Hurst parameter H < 1/2. A major appeal of such models lies in their ability to parsimoniously recover key stylized facts of market IV surfaces such as the exploding power-law behaviour of the ATM volatility skew near zero, a crucial feature Markovian models fail to reproduce. On the flipside, as a consequence of fBM being neither a semimartingale nor a Markov process for H not equal to 1/2, most currently prevalent numerical pricing and calibration routines do not (easily) carry over to the rough setting. This thesis addresses this problem and contributes to the existing literature as follows. In chapter 2, we sharpen the large deviations results of Forde-Zhang (2017) in a way that allows us to zoom-in around the money while maintaining full analytical tractability. More precisely, this amounts to proving higher order moderate deviations (MD) estimates, only recently introduced in the option pricing context. In particular, we derive small-time asymptotic formulae for log call prices and Black-Scholes implied volatility. This in turn allows us to push the applicability range of known ATM skew approximation formulae from CLT type log-moneyness deviations of order t^1/2 to the wider MD regime. In chapter 3, we present a novel Monte Carlo (MC) pricing scheme for rough volatility models based on a Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve-style approximation of White Noise. This complements theoretical results by Bayer et al. (2017). Our numerical experiments confirm a theoretical strong rate of H for a central object of interest and indicate a weak rate of 2H for the option price. In chapter 4, we introduce a novel model calibration routine for (rough) stochastic volatility models dubbed deep calibration. Standard model calibration routines rely on the [...]",

In particular, rough volatility models, where the instantaneous volatility is driven by a fractional Brownian motion, provide a more accurate fit of the power-law decay observed on volatility smiles close to maturity. This thesis is concerned with deriving the asymptotic behaviour of these two classes of stochastic volatility models using large deviations techniques, in order to understand the behaviour of the implied volatility. Indeed, when pricing options, a closed-form solution to the pricing problem is often not available. Practitioners are using implied volatility as a measure of option prices that is consistent for different options with different maturities and strike prices. As this implied volatility cannot be expressed in closed form either, finding asymptotic formulas is crucial. We therefore focus on ob- taining the asymptotic behaviour of two rough volatility models, namely a generalised version of the Stein-Stein model where the volatility starts from a random distribution and the (multi-factor) rough Bergomi model for realised variance options. We also study a particular complete model with stochas- tic volatility, which can be fitted to market data perfectly via the leverage function. In each case, we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the stock price process and the implied volatility. We produce numerical schemes to compute the implied volatility smiles.",

        "abstract": "G atheral et al (2014) discovered that historical volatility time series exhibit behaviour that is much rougher than that of a Brownian motion for a wide range of assets. These authors also showed the dynamics of log volatility can be well modelled by a fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst parameter of order 0.1. In the literature, there exist various opinions as to whether the Hurst index should be less than 1/2 (short memory) or above 1/2 (long memory), depending on the particular asset class. As mentioned in Funahashi & Kijima (2017), it is well known that (i) the decrease in market volatility smile amplitude is much slower than predicted by the standard stochastic volatility models and (ii) the term structure of the at-the-money volatility skew is well approximated by a powerlaw function with an exponent close to zero. These stylised facts cannot be captured by standard models, and while (i) has been explained using a fractional volatility model with the Hurst index H > 1=2, (ii) is proven to be satisfied by a rough volatility model with H < 1=2 under a risk-neutral measure. For more detail, see Funahashi & Kijima (2017) and the references therein. In Livieri et al (2018), the value of the Hurst exponent obtained via high-frequency volatility estimations from historical price data is revisited by studying implied volatility-based approximations of the spot volatility. Using at-the-money options on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index with short maturity, the authors confirm the volatility is rough and the Hurst parameter is of order 0.3, ie, slightly larger than that usually obtained from historical data. Despite the fact that rough volatility models have already been elaborated on and there exists a rich literature on the subject, due to the non-Markovian nature of the fractional Brownian motion, one can face some technical problems when it comes to derivatives pricing. Pricing variance swaps is evenmore complicated.Therefore, in this article, we attempt to attack the rough volatility problem using some approximation to the fractional Brownian motion, which, however, is a semi-martingale.",

        "abstract": "Rough volatility models have brought a breeze of fresh air into financial modelling, which historically has been mostly tied to Markovian models. Alas, this novelty comes with a number of challenges and questions that require new techniques to be answered. The present thesis first explores the numerical implementation of rough volatility models, both to provide convergence results and to ensure a competitive implementation. Our findings conclude that fractional calculus and H\u00f6lder spaces provide the right framework to set the theoretical grounds of numerical schemes related to rough volatility models and fractional diffusions in general. In addition, we explore the use of deep learning methods to leverage the speed of numerical schemes and provide state-of-the-art calibration techniques that make rough volatility models as simple and efficient to implement as the Black-Scholes formula. The second part of the thesis explores the theoretical properties of rough volatility models regarding volatility products such as VIX and realized variance options. We explore short-time asymptotics using two different techniques: Malliavin Calculus and Large Deviations Principle. Remarkably, we find that both approaches complement each other and provide a very accurate description of the short-time implied volatility smile. Building upon these short-time asymptotics, we further provide approximation formulas for the at-the-money implied volatility and its skew. Finally, in the third part of the thesis we cross the bridge between the physical P and risk-neutral Q measures. We provide sufficient conditions for such change of measure to be well defined and explore the numerical estimation of the market risk premium process in rough volatility models.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the work of Al'os, Le \u0301on and Vives [ALV07] and Fukasawa [Fuk17], who showed that a volatility process driven by a fractional Brownian motion generates the power law at-the-money volatility skew observed in financial market data, Gatheral, Jaisson and Rosenbaum [GJR18a] spawned a class of models now known as rough volatility models. We study the asymptotic behaviour of such models, and investigate how convolutional neural networks can be used for their calibration. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction. We begin with implied volatility, and then intro- duce a number of model classes, starting with local volatility models and ending with rough volatility models, and discuss their associated asymptotic behaviour. We also introduce the theoretical tools used to prove the main results. In Chapter 2 we study the small-time behaviour of the rough Bergomi model, introduced by Bayer, Friz, and Gatheral [BFG16]. We prove a pathwise large deviations principle for a small-noise version of the model, and use this result to establish the small-time behaviour of the rescaled log stock price process. This, in turn, allows us to characterise the small-time implied volatility behaviour of the model. Using the same theoretical framework, we are also able to establish the small-time implied volatility behaviour of the lognormal fSABR model of Akahori, Song, and Wang [ASW17]. In Chapter 3 we present small-time implied volatility asymptotics for realised variance (RV) options for a number of (rough) stochastic volatility models via a large deviations principle. We interestingly discover that these (rough) volatility models, together with others proposed in the literature, generate linear smiles around the money. We provide numerical results along with efficient and robust numerical recipes to compute the rate function; the backbone of our theoretical framework. Based on our results, we develop an approximation scheme for the density of the realised variance, which in turn allows the volatility swap density to be expressed i [...]",

        "abstract": "In quantitative finance, modeling the volatility structure of underlying assets is vital to pricing options. Rough stochastic volatility models, such as the rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral, Quantitative Finance 16(6), 887-904, 2016], seek to fit observed market data based on the observation that the log-realized variance behaves like a fractional Brownian motion with small Hurst parameter, H < 1/2, over reasonable timescales. Both time series of asset prices and option-derived price data indicate that H often takes values close to 0.1 or less, i.e., rougher than Brownian motion. This change improves the fit to both option prices and time series of underlying asset prices while maintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of the driving fractional Brownian motion in rough volatility models poses severe challenges for theoretical and numerical analyses and for computational practice. While the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution of the rough Bergomi and similar models, its strong rate of convergence is only H. We prove rate H + 1/2 for the weak convergence of the Euler method for the rough Stein-Stein model, which treats the volatility as a linear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion, and, surprisingly, we prove rate one for the case of quadratic payoff functions. Our proof uses Talay-Tubaro expansions and an affine Markovian representation of the underlying and is further supported by numerical experiments. These convergence results provide a first step toward deriving weak rates for the rough Bergomi model, which treats the volatility as a nonlinear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion.",

However, due to the non-Markovian and non-semimartingale nature of the volatility process, there is no simple way to simulate efficiently such models, which makes risk management of derivatives an intricate task. In this paper, we design tractable multi-factor stochastic volatility models approximating rough volatility models and enjoying a Markovian structure. Furthermore, we apply our procedure to the specific case of the rough Heston model. This in turn enables us to derive a numerical method for solving fractional Riccati equations appearing in the characteristic function of the log-price in this setting.",

        "abstract": "We consider a class of stochastic processes with rough stochastic volatility, examples of which include the rough Bergomi and rough Stein-Stein model, that have gained considerable importance in quantitative finance. A basic question for such (non-Markovian) models concerns efficient numerical schemes. While strong rates are well understood (order $H$), we tackle here the intricate question of weak rates. Our main result asserts that the weak rate, for a reasonably large class of test function, is essentially of order $\\min \\{ 3H+\\tfrac12, 1 \\}$ where $H \\in (0,1/2]$ is the Hurst parameter of the fractional Brownian motion that underlies the rough volatility process. Interestingly, the phase transitation at $H=1/6$ is related to the correlation between the two driving factors, and thus gives additional meaning to a quantity already of central importance in stochastic volatility modelling. Our results are complemented by a lower bound which show that the obtained weak rate is indeed optimal.",

Rough volatility models also generate\na local volatility surface, via the so-called Markovian projection of the\nstochastic volatility. We complement the existing results on the implied\nvolatility by studying the asymptotic behavior of the local volatility surface\ngenerated by a class of rough stochastic volatility models, encompassing the\nrough Bergomi model. Notably, we observe that the celebrated \"1/2 skew rule\"\nlinking the short-term at-the-money skew of the implied volatility to the\nshort-term at-the-money skew of the local volatility, a consequence of the\ncelebrated \"harmonic mean formula\" of [Berestycki, Busca, and Florent, QF\n2002], is replaced by a new rule: the ratio of the at-the-money implied and\nlocal volatility skews tends to the constant 1/(H + 3/2) (as opposed to the\nconstant 1/2), where H is the regularity index of the underlying instantaneous\nvolatility process.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been substantive empirical evidence that stochastic volatility is rough. In other words, the local behavior of stochastic volatility is much more irregular than semimartingales and resembles that of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H < 0 . 5 . In this paper, we derive a consistent and asymptotically mixed normal estimator of H based on high-frequency price observations. In contrast to previous works, we work in a semiparametric setting and do not assume any a priori relationship between volatility estimators and true volatility. Furthermore, our estimator attains a rate of convergence that is known to be optimal in a minimax sense in parametric rough volatility models.",

We introduce a non-parametric method for estimating the roughness of a function based on discrete sample, using the concept of normalized p -th variation along a sequence of partitions. We investigate the \ufb01nite sample performance of our estimator for measuring the roughness of sample paths of stochastic processes using detailed numerical experiments based on sample paths of fractional Brownian motion and other fractional processes. We then apply this method to estimate the roughness of realized volatility signals based on high-frequency observations. Detailed numerical experiments based on stochastic volatility models show that, even when the instantaneous volatility has di\ufb00usive dynamics with the same roughness as Brownian motion, the realized volatility exhibits rough behaviour corresponding to a Hurst exponent signi\ufb01cantly smaller than 0 . 5. Comparison of roughness estimates for realized and instantaneous volatility in fractional volatility models with di\ufb00erent values of Hurst exponent shows that, irrespective of the roughness of the spot volatility process, realized volatility always exhibits \u2018rough\u2019 behaviour with an apparent Hurst index (cid:98) H < 0 . 5. These results suggest that the origin of the roughness observed in realized volatility time-series lies in the microstructure noise rather than the volatility process itself.",

Although rough fractional stochastic volatility models already proved to be superior in real market data fitting, techniques used in simulation of these models are still inefficient in terms of speed and accuracy. This paper aims to present accurate and efficient tools and techniques for Monte-Carlo simulations for a wide range of rough volatility models. In particular, we compare three commonly used simulation methods: the Cholesky method, the Hybrid scheme, and the rDonsker scheme. We also comment on the implementation of variance reduction techniques. In particular, we show the obstacles of the so-called turbocharging technique whose performance is sometimes counter-productive. To overcome these obstacles, we suggest several modifications.",

First, we develop efficient Monte Carlo methods and asymptotic approximations for computing option prices and hedge ratios in models where log-volatility follows a Gaussian Volterra process. While providing a good fit for European options, these models are unable to reproduce the VIX option smile observed in the market, and are thus not suitable for VIX products. To accommodate these, we introduce the class of modulated Volterra processes, and show that they successfully capture the VIX smile.",

This can be viewed as a more practical variant of Theorem 3.1 in Fukasawa [Short-time at-the-money skew and rough fractional volatility. Quant. Finance, 2017, 17(2), 189\u2013198] (Fukasawa [Short-time at-the-money skew and rough fractional volatility. Quant. Finance, 2017, 17(2), 189\u2013198] does not allow for jumps or a finite history and uses the somewhat opaque Muravlev representation for fractional Brownian motion), or if we turn off the rough stochastic volatility, the expansion is a variant of the main result in Mijatovic and Tankov [A new look at short-term implied volatility in asset price models with jumps. Math. Finance, 2016, 26(1), 149\u2013183] and Theorem 3.2 in Figueroa-L\u00f3pez et al. [Third-order short-time expansions for close-to-the-money option prices under the CGMY model. J. Appl. Math. Finance, 2017, 24, 547\u2013574]. The regime is directly applicable to FX options where options are typically quoted in terms of delta (.10,.25 and .50) not absolute strikes, and we also compute a new prediction formula for the Riemann-Liouville process, which allows us to express the history term for the Edgeworth expansion in a more useable form in terms of the volatility process itself. We later relax the assumption of bounded volatility, and we also compute a formal small-time expansion for implied volatility in the Rough Heston model in the same regime (without jumps) which includes an additional at-the-money, convexity and fourth order correction term, and we outline how one can go to even higher order in the three separate cases , and .

We however find by simulations that the impressive approach tends to suggest the same roughness irrespectively whether the volatility is actually rough or not; an overlooked estimation error of latent volatility often results in an illusive scaling property. Motivated by this preliminary finding, here we develop a statistical theory for a continuous time fractional stochastic volatility model to examine whether the Hurst parameter is indeed estimated smaller than half, that is, whether the volatility is really rough. We construct a quasi-likelihood estimator and apply it to realized volatility time series. Our quasi-likelihood is based on the error distribution of the realized volatility and a Whittle-type approximation to the auto-covariance of the log-volatility process. We prove the consistency of our estimator under high frequency asymptotics, and examine by simulations its finite sample performance. Our empirical study suggests that the volatility is indeed rough; actually it is even rougher than considered in the literature.",

        "abstract": "We study an extension of the Heston stochastic volatility model that incorporates rough volatility and jump clustering phenomena. In our model, named the rough Hawkes Heston stochastic volatility model, the spot variance is a rough Hawkes-type process proportional to the intensity process of the jump component appearing in the dynamics of the spot variance itself and the log returns. The model belongs to the class of a\ufb03ne Volterra models. In particular, the Fourier-Laplace transform of the log returns and the square of the volatility index can be computed explicitly in terms of solutions of deterministic Riccati-Volterra equations, which can be e\ufb03ciently approximated using a multi-factor approximation technique. We calibrate a parsimonious speci\ufb01cation of our model characterized by a power kernel and an exponential law for the jumps. We show that our parsimonious setup is able to simultaneously capture, with a high precision, the behavior of the implied volatility smile for both S&P 500 and VIX options. In particular, we observe that in our setting the usual shift in the implied volatility of VIX options is explained by a very low value of the power in the kernel. Our \ufb01ndings demonstrate the relevance, under an a\ufb03ne framework, of rough volatility and self-exciting jumps in order to capture the joint evolution of the S&P 500 and VIX.",

        "abstract": "Rough volatility is a well-established statistical stylised fact of financial assets. This property has lead to the design and analysis of various new rough stochastic volatility models. However, most of these developments have been carried out in the mono-asset case. In this work, we show that some specific multivariate rough volatility models arise naturally from microstructural properties of the joint dynamics of asset prices. To do so, we use Hawkes processes to build microscopic models that reproduce accurately high frequency cross-asset interactions and investigate their long term scaling limits. We emphasize the relevance of our approach by providing insights on the role of microscopic features such as momentum and meanreversion on the multidimensional price formation process. We in particular recover classical properties of high-dimensional stock correlation matrices.",

Our findings lead to new stylized facts in the log-log plots of the second moments of realized variance increments against lag which exhibit some convexity in addition to the roughness and stationarity of the volatility. The very low perceived Hurst exponents at small scales is consistent with the rough framework, while the higher perceived Hurst exponents for larger scales leads to a nonlinear behavior of the log-log plot that has not been described by models introduced so far.",

Ceci est fait en six etapes. Dans une premiere partie, on explique cette propriete a partir des comportements typiques des agents sur le marche. Plus precisement, on construit un modele de prix microscopique base sur les processus de Hawkes reproduisant les faits stylises importants de la microstructure des marches. En etudiant le comportement du prix a long terme, on montre l\u2019emergence d\u2019une version rugueuse du modele de Heston (appele modele rough Heston) avec effet de levier. En utilisant ce lien original entre les processus de Hawkes et les modeles de Heston, on calcule dans la deuxieme partie de cette these la fonction caracteristique du log-prix du modele rough Heston. Cette fonction caracteristique est donnee en terme d\u2019une solution d\u2019une equation de Riccati dans le cas du modele de Heston classique. On montre la validite d\u2019une formule similaire dans le cas du modele rough Heston, ou l\u2019equation de Riccati est remplacee par sa version fractionnaire. Cette formule nous permet de surmonter les difficultes techniques dues au caractere non markovien du modele afin de valoriser des produits derives. Dans la troisieme partie, on aborde la question de la gestion des risques des produits derives dans le modele rough Heston. On presente des strategies de couverture utilisant comme instruments l\u2019actif sous-jacent et la courbe variance forward. Ceci est fait en specifiant la structure markovienne infini-dimensionnelle du modele. Etant capable de valoriser et couvrir les produits derives dans le modele rough Heston, nous confrontons ce modele a la realite des marches financiers dans la quatrieme partie. Plus precisement, on montre qu\u2019il reproduit le comportement de la volatilite implicite et historique. On montre egalement qu\u2019il genere l\u2019effet Zumbach qui est une asymetrie par inversion du temps observee empiriquement sur les donnees financieres. On etudie dans la cinquieme partie le comportement limite de la volatilite implicite a la monnaie a faible maturite dans le cadre d\u2019un modele a volatilite stochastique general (incluant le modele rough Bergomi), en appliquant un developpement de la densite du prix de l\u2019actif. Alors que l\u2019approximation basee sur les processus de Hawkes a permis de traiter plusieurs questions relatives au modele rough Heston, nous examinons dans la sixieme partie une approximation markovienne s\u2019appliquant sur une classe plus generale de modeles a volatilite rugueuse. En utilisant cette approximation dans le cas particulier du modele rough Heston, on obtient une methode numerique pour resoudre les equations de Riccati fractionnaires. Enfin, nous terminons cette these en etudiant un probleme non lie a la litterature sur la volatilite rugueuse. Nous considerons le cas d\u2019une plateforme cherchant le meilleur systeme de make-take fees pour attirer de la liquidite. En utilisant le cadre principal-agent, on decrit le meilleur contrat a proposer au market maker ainsi que les cotations optimales affichees par ce dernier. Nous montrons egalement que cette politique conduit a une meilleure liquidite et a une baisse des couts de transaction pour les investisseurs.",

        "abstract": ". In quantitative \ufb01nance, modeling the volatility structure of underlying assets is vital to pricing options. Rough stochastic volatility models, such as the rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral, Quantitative Finance 16(6), 887-904, 2016], seek to \ufb01t observed market data based on the observation that the log-realized variance behaves like a fractional Brownian motion with small Hurst parameter, H < 1 / 2, over reasonable timescales. Both time series of asset prices and option-derived price data indicate that H often takes values close to 0 . 1 or less, i.e., rougher than Brownian motion. This change improves the \ufb01t to both option prices and time series of underlying asset prices while maintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of the driving fractional Brownian motion in rough volatility models poses severe challenges for theoretical and numerical analyses and for computational practice. While the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution of the rough Bergomi and similar models, its strong rate of convergence is only H . We prove rate H + 1 / 2 for the weak convergence of the Euler method for the rough Stein\u2013Stein model, which treats the volatility as a linear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion, and, surprisingly, we prove rate one for the case of quadratic payo\ufb00 functions. Indeed, the problem of weak convergence for rough volatility models is very subtle; we provide examples demonstrating the rate of convergence for payo\ufb00 functions that are well approximated by second-order polynomials, as weighted by the law of the fractional Brownian motion, may be hard to distinguish from rate one empirically. Our proof uses Talay\u2013Tubaro expansions and an a\ufb03ne Markovian representation of the underlying and is further supported by numerical experiments. These convergence results provide a \ufb01rst step toward deriving weak rates for the rough Bergomi model, which treats the volatility as a nonlinear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion.",

In the absence of analytical European option pricing methods for the model, we focus on reducing the runtime-adjusted variance of Monte Carlo implied volatilities, thereby contributing to the model's calibration by simulation. We employ a novel composition of variance reduction methods, immediately applicable to any conditionally log-normal stochastic volatility model. Assuming one targets implied volatility estimates with a given degree of confidence, thus calibration RMSE, the results we demonstrate equate to significant runtime reductions-roughly 20 times on average, across different correlation regimes.",

This property has led to the design and analysis of various new rough stochastic volatility models. However, most of these developments have been carried out in the mono-asset case. In this work, we show that some specific multivariate rough volatility models arise naturally from microstructural properties of the joint dynamics of asset prices. To do so, we use Hawkes processes to build microscopic models that accurately reproduce high-frequency cross-asset interactions and investigate their long-term scaling limits. We emphasize the relevance of our approach by providing insights on the role of microscopic features such as momentum and mean-reversion in the multidimensional price formation process. In particular, we recover classical properties of high-dimensional stock correlation matrices.",

The so-obtained log-modulated fractional Brownian motion (log-fBm) is a continuous Gaussian process even for H = 0. As a consequence, the resulting super-rough stochastic volatility models can be analysed over the whole range 0 \u2264 H < 1/2 without the need of further normalization. We obtain skew asymptotics of the form log(1/T)^-p T^H-1/2 as T\u2192 0, H \u2265 0, so no flattening of the skew occurs as H \u2192 0.",

        "abstract": "A rough volatility model contains a stochastic Volterra integral with a weakly singular kernel. The classical Euler-Maruyama algorithm is not very efficient for simulating this kind of model because one needs to keep records of all the past path-values and thus the computational complexity is too large. This paper develops a fast two-step iteration algorithm using an approximation of the weakly singular kernel with a sum of exponential functions. Compared to the Euler-Maruyama algorithm, the complexity of the fast algorithm is reduced from to or for simulating one path, where N is the number of time steps. Further, the fast algorithm is developed to simulate rough Heston models with (or without) regime switching, and multi-factor approximation algorithms are also studied and compared. The convergence rates of the Euler-Maruyama algorithm and the fast algorithm are proved. A number of numerical examples are carried out to confirm the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by recent applications in rough volatility and regularity structures, notably the notion of singular modelled distribution, we study paths, rough paths and related objects with a quantified singularity at zero. In a pure path setting this allows us to leverage on existing SLE Besov estimates to see that SLE traces takes values in a singular H\u00f6lder space, which quantifies a well-known boundary effect in the regime \u03ba < 1. We then consider the integration theory against singular rough paths and some extensions thereof. This gives a method to reconcile, from a regularity structure point of view, different singular kernels used to construct (fractional) rough volatility models and an effective reduction to the stationary case which is crucial to apply general renormalisation methods.",

The resulting Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility (RFSV) model is remarkably consistent with financial time series data. We now show how the RFSV model can be used to price claims on both the underlying and integrated volatility. We analyze in detail a simple case of this model, the rBergomi model. In particular, we find that the rBergomi model fits the SPX volatility markedly better than conventional Markovian stochastic volatility models, and with fewer parameters. Finally, we show that actual SPX variance swap curves seem to be consistent with model forecasts, with particular dramatic examples from the weekend of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Flash Crash.",
