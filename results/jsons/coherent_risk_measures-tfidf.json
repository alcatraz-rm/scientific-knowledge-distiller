        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the extent to which any risk measure can lead to superadditive risk assessments, implying the potential for penalizing portfolio diversification. For this purpose we introduce the notion of extreme-aggregation risk measures. The extreme-aggregation measure characterizes the most superadditive behavior of a risk measure, by yielding the worst-possible diversification ratio across dependence structures. One of the main contributions is demonstrating that, for a wide range of risk measures, the extreme-aggregation measure corresponds to the smallest dominating coherent risk measure. In our main result, it is shown that the extremeaggregation measure induced by a distortion risk measure is a coherent distortion risk measure. In the case of convex risk measures, a general robust representation of coherent extreme-aggregation measures is provided. In particular, the extreme-aggregation measure induced by a convex shortfall risk measure is a coherent expectile. These results show that, in the presence of dependence uncertainty, quantification of a coherent risk measure is often necessary, an observation that lends further support to the use of coherent risk measures in portfolio risk management",

By combining the performance evaluation with the risk control, we study in particular the performance ratio-based coherent risk (PRCR) measures, which is a sub-class of generalized shortfall risk measures. The PRCR measures are tractable and have a suitable financial interpretation. Based on the PRCR measure, we establish a portfolio selection model with transaction costs. Empirical results show that the optimal portfolio obtained under the PRCR measure performs much better than the corresponding optimal portfolio obtained under the higher moment coherent risk measure.",

        "abstract": "This article proposes a new coherent risk measure called iso-entropic risk measure, which is based on relative entropy under the theory framework of Artzner et al.(1999). It is pointed that this measure is just the negative expectation of the risk portfolio position under the probability measure through Esscher transformation. This iso-entropic risk measure is not a 0-1 risk measure and very smooth in contrast with another important coherent risk measure AV @R (Average Value at Risk). And it is a little larger than AV @R at the same level, namely it is has more prudence. So it maybe a better coherent risk measure.",

Market risk is caused by the uncertainty attached to asset values. There exit various measures trying to model market risk. The most widely accepted one is Valueat-Risk. However Value-at-Risk does not encourage portfolio diversification in general, whereas a consistent risk measure has to do so. In this work, risk measures satisfying these consistency conditions are examined within theoretical basis. Different types of coherent and convex risk measures are investigated. Moreover the extension of coherent risk measures to multiperiod settings is discussed.",

We introduce the notion of coherent risk measure defined on an arbitrary set of risks, showing that it can be considered a special case of coherent upper prevision. We also prove that our definition generalizes the notion of coherence for risk measures defined on a linear space of random numbers, given in literature. We also show that Value-at-Risk does not necessarily satisfy a weaker notion of coherence called \u2018avoiding sure loss\u2019 (ASL), and discuss both sufficient conditions for VaR to avoid sure loss and ways of modifying VaR into a coherent risk measure.",

To overcome these problems in risk measurement a class of coherent risk measures has been proposed. We introduce the idea behind these measures and provide an overview of suggested coherent risk measures. Finally it is shown where the limitations of such measures in practical applications are and how regulatory bodies responded to their introduction in the literature. We find that most contributions on coherent risk measurement come from the actuarial sciences and propagate a widening of the discussion among researchers and practitioners in other industries.",

        "abstract": "Coherent measures of risk defined by the axioms of monotonicity, subadditivity, positive homogeneity, and translation invariance are recent tools in risk management to assess the amount of risk agents are exposed to. If they also satisfy law invariance and comonotonic additivity, then we get a subclass of them: spectral measures of risk. Expected shortfall is a well-known spectral measure of risk. We investigate the above mentioned six axioms using tools from general equilibrium (GE) theory. Coherent and spectral measures of risk are compared to the natural measure of risk derived from an exchange economy model, which we call the GE measure of risk. We prove that GE measures of risk are coherent measures of risk. We also show that spectral measures of risk are GE measures of risk only under stringent conditions, since spectral measures of risk do not take the regulated entity's relation to the market portfolio into account. To give more insights, we characterize the set of GE measures of risk via the pricing kernel property.",

We give necessary and sufficient conditions on \u03c6 for M\u03c6 to be a coherent measure. We find in this way a simple interpretation of the concept of coherence and a way to map any rational investor\u2019s subjective risk aversion onto a coherent measure and vice\u2014versa. We also provide for these measures their discrete versions M (N) \u03c6 acting on finite sets of N independent realizations of a r.v. which are not only shown to be coherent measures for any fixed N , but also consistent estimators of M\u03c6 for large N .",

Yet, VaR is not a coherent risk measure because it is not sub-additive. This paper applies the methodology of risk budgeting to determine if VaR qualifies as a coherent risk measure. We show that the tools of risk budgeting allow VaR to be treated as a coherent risk measure, even though it does not restore sub-additivity. The main finding is that the additional analysis provided by risk budgeting means that VaR is a useful tool even if it is not sub-additive.",

All have been widely used to assess financial riskiness under uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate differences amongst these risk measures and expectations. For this purpose, we constrain our attention of coherent and convex risk measures, and Choquet expectation to the domain of g-expectation. Some differences among coherent and convex risk measures and Choquet expectations are accounted for in the framework of g-expectations. We show that in the family of convex risk measures, only coherent risk measures satisfy Jensen's inequality. In mathematical finance, risk measures and Choquet expectations are typically used in the pricing of contingent claims over families of measures. The different risk measures will typically yield different pricing. In this paper, we show that the coherent pricing is always less than the corresponding Choquet pricing. This property and inequality fails in general when one uses pricing by convex risk measures. We also discuss the relation between static risk measure and dynamic risk measure in the framework of g-expectations. We show that if g-expectations yield coherent (convex) risk measures then the corresponding conditional g-expectations or equivalently the dynamic risk measure is also coherent (convex). To prove these results, we establish a new converse of the comparison theorem of g-expectations.",

In this space, the concept of \u201cRisk Aversion Function\u201d \u03c6 naturally arises as the spectral representation of each risk measure in a space of functions of confidence level probabilities. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on \u03c6 for M\u03c6 to be a coherent measure. We find in this way a simple interpretation of the concept of coherence and a way to map any rational investor\u2019s subjective risk aversion onto a coherent measure and vice\u2013versa. We also provide for these measures their discrete versions M (N) \u03c6 acting on finite sets of N independent realizations of a r.v. which are not only shown to be coherent measures for any fixed N , but also consistent estimators of M\u03c6 for large N . Finally, we find in our results some interesting and not yet fully investigated relationships with certain results known in insurance mathematical literature.",

        "abstract": "Deceased Choosing a proper external risk measure is of great regulatory importance, as exemplified in the Basel II and Basel III Accords, which use value-at-risk with scenario analysis as the risk measures for setting capital requirements. We argue that a good external risk measure should be robust with respect to model misspecification and small changes in the data. A new class of data-based risk measures called natural risk statistics is proposed to incorporate robustness. Natural risk statistics are characterized by a new set of axioms. They include the Basel II and III risk measures and a subclass of robust risk measures as special cases; therefore, they provide a theoretical framework for understanding and, if necessary, extending the Basel Accords. comonotonic random variables studied in the actuarial literature such as Wang et al. [49], we shall define a new class of risk measures that satisfy a new set of axioms. The new class of risk measures includes VaR with scenario analysis, and particularly the Basel II and Basel III risk measures, as special cases. Thus, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding and extending the Basel Accords when needed. Indeed, the framework includes as special cases some proposals to address the procyclicality problem in Basel II such as the countercyclical indexing risk measure suggested by Gordy and Howells [20] . The objective of a risk measure is an important issue that has not been well addressed in the existing literature. In terms of objectives, risk measures can be classified into two categories: internal risk measures used for internal risk management at individual institutions and external risk measures used for external regulation and imposed for all the relevant institutions. The differences between internal and external risk measures mirror the differences between internal standards (such as morality) and external standards (such as law and regulation). Internal risk measures are applied in the interest of an institution's shareholders or managers, whereas external risk measures are used by regulatory agencies to maintain safety and soundness of the financial system. A risk measure may be suitable for internal management but not for external regulation, or vice versa. In this paper, we shall focus on external risk measures from the viewpoint of regulatory agencies. In particular, we emphasize that an external risk measure should be robust (see \u00a75). The main results of the paper are as follows: (i) We postulate a new set of axioms and define a new class of risk measures called natural risk statistics; furthermore, we give two complete characterizations of natural risk statistics ( \u00a73.2). (ii) We show that natural risk statistics include the Basel II and Basel III risk measures as special cases and thus provide an axiomatic framework for understanding and, if necessary, extending them ( \u00a74). (iii) We completely characterize data-based coherent risk measures and show that no coherent risk measure is robust with respect to small changes in the data ( \u00a7 \u00a73.3 and 5.6). (iv) We completely characterize data-based insurance risk measures and show that no insurance risk measure is robust with respect to model misspecification ( \u00a7 \u00a73.4 and 5.6). (v) We argue that an external risk measure should be robust, motivated by philosophy of law and issues in external regulations ( \u00a75). (vi) We show that median shortfall, a special case of natural risk statistics, is more robust than expected shortfall suggested by coherent risk measures ( \u00a75.4). (vii) We show that natural risk statistics include a subclass of robust risk measures that are suitable for external regulation ( \u00a75.5). (viii) We provide other critiques of the subadditivity axiom of coherent risk measures from the viewpoints of diversification and bankruptcy protection ( \u00a76). (ix) We derive the Euler capital allocation rule under a subclass of natural risk statistics including the Basel II and III risk measures ( \u00a77). Review of existing risk measures. 2.1. Coherent and convex risk measures. Artzner et al. [5] propose the coherent risk measures that satisfy the following three axioms: Axiom A1. Translation invariance and positive homogeneity: Axiom A1 states that the risk of a financial position is proportional to its size, and a sure loss of amount b simply increases the risk by b. Axiom A1 is proposed from the accounting viewpoint. For external risk measures such as those used for setting margin deposits and capital requirements, the accounting-based axiom seems to be reasonable. Axiom A2 is a minimum requirement for a reasonable risk measure. What is questionable lies in Axiom A3, which basically means that \"a merger does not create extra risk\" (see Artzner et al. [5, p. 209]). We will discuss the controversies related to this axiom in \u00a76. Artzner et al. [5] and Delbaen [11] also present an equivalent approach for defining coherent risk measures via acceptance sets. F\u00f6llmer and Schied [14] and Frittelli and Gianin [15] propose the convex risk measures that relax Axioms A1 and A3 to a single convexity axiom: \u2200 \u2208 0 1 . A risk measure is coherent if and only if there exists a family of probability measures such that X = sup Q\u2208 E Q X \u2200X \u2208 , where E Q X is the expectation of X under the probability measure Q (see Huber [25], Artzner et al. [5], Delbane [11] ). Each Q \u2208 can be viewed as a prior probability, so measuring risk by a coherent risk measure amounts to computing the maximal expectation under a set of prior probabilities. Coherent and convex risk measures are closely connected to the good deal bounds of asset prices in incomplete markets (see, e.g., Jaschke and K\u00fcchler [30], Staum [45]).",

A detailed discussion of this can be found in two papers by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber and Heath, ADEH1 and ADEH2. It will not be repeated here. We will rather concentrate on the mathematics behind the concept of coherent risk measures. They were introduced in the two mentioned papers and the mathematical theory was further developped in Delbaen (1999), D2. Further use of coherent risk measures can be found in the papers (and their references) by Jaschke, Ja and JaK, Tasche, AT and F\u00f6llmer-Schied, FS. The reader should consult the cited web-sites to find several papers dealing with this subject. The paper by F\u00f6llmer and Schied introduces a generalisation of coherent risk measures.",

We say that a pair of risk measures is asymptotically equivalent if the ratio of the worst\u2010case values of the two risk measures is almost one for the sum of a large number of risks with unknown dependence structure. The study of asymptotic equivalence is particularly important for a pair of a noncoherent risk measure and a coherent risk measure, as the worst\u2010case value of a noncoherent risk measure under dependence uncertainty is typically difficult to obtain. The main contribution of this paper is to establish general asymptotic equivalence results for the classes of distortion risk measures and convex risk measures under different mild conditions. The results implicitly suggest that it is only reasonable to implement a coherent risk measure for the aggregation of a large number of risks with uncertainty in the dependence structure, a relevant situation for risk management practice.",

The measures in this class, which arise when the controversial subadditivity property of coherent risk measures is dispensed with and positive homogeneity is weakened, include all practically used risk measures, in particular, both convex risk measures and Value-at-Risk. From a financial viewpoint, our relaxation of convexity is necessary to quantify the capital requirements for risk exposure in the presence of liquidity risk, competitive delegation, or robust aggregation mechanisms. From a decision theoretical perspective, star-shaped risk measures emerge from variational preferences when risk mitigation strategies can be adopted by a rational decision maker.",

This measure shares several desirable characteristics with the coherent risk measures, as illustrated in Artzner et al. (1997) . In Vietnam, our study makes the first attempt to utilize distortion theory, instead of utility theory, to facilitate the adoption of risk aversion level in the popular risk measures. We find that spectral risk measure is more flexible and effective to different groups of risk-adverse investors, compared to the more monotonic and conventional VaR and ES measures.",

        "abstract": "Axiomatically based risk measures have been the object of numerous studies and generalizations in recent years. In the literature we find two main schools: coherent risk measures (Artzner, Coherent Measures of Risk. Risk Management: Value at Risk and Beyond, 1998) and insurance risk measures (Wang, Insur Math Econ 21:173-183, 1997). In this note, we set to study yet another extension motivated by a third axiomatically based risk measure that has been recently introduced. In Heyde et al. (Working Paper, Columbia University, 2007), the concept of natural risk statistic is discussed as a data-based risk measure, i.e. as an axiomatic risk measure defined in the space R n . One drawback of these kind of risk measures is their dependence on the space dimension n. In order to circumvent this issue, we propose a way to define a family {\u03c1 n } n=1,2,... of natural risk statistics whose members are defined on R n and related in an appropriate way. This construction requires the generalization of natural risk statistics to the space of infinite sequences l \u221e .",

First, the denition of a dynamic coherent measure is introduced and some relations with its static version are given. Coherent measures are characterized by martingale-like representations, as well as by Choquet integrals of probability distortion operators. Using dieren t information updating rules (e.g. Bayes or DempsterShafer) we dene three distinct families of dynamic coherent measures. In particular, we extend Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Conditional Expectation (TCE) to a dynamic setting.",

By using the separation theorem for convex sets and the truncated approximation method, we obtain that VaR can be represented by continuous coherent risk measures on L-space. Meanwhile, we get a new method to prove the representation result for the continuous coherent risk measures on L-space, which extend the results in [2] from L\u221e-space to L-space, and do some complements of that of Inoue [4], respectively.",
