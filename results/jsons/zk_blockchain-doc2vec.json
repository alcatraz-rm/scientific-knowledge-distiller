Its applications are far beyond the financial sector. The transaction verification process for cryptocurrencies is much slower than traditional digital transaction systems. One approach to scalability or the speed at which transactions are processed is to design a solution that offers faster Proof of Work. In this paper, we propose a method for accelerating the process of Proof of Work based on parallel mining rather than solo mining. The goal is to ensure that no more than two or more miners put the same effort into solving a specific block. The proposed method includes a process for selection of a manager, distribution of work and a reward system. This method has been implemented in a test environment that contains all the characteristics needed to perform Proof of Work for Bitcoin and has been tested, using a variety of case scenarios, by varying the difficulty level and number of validators. Experimental evaluations were performed locally and in a cloud environment, and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This thesis investigates the application of AI and blockchain technology to the domain of Algorithmic Regulation. Algorithmic Regulation refers to the use of intelligent systems for the enabling and enforcement of regulation (often referred to as RegTech in financial services). The research work focuses on three problems: a) Machine interpretability of regulation; b) Regulatory reporting of data; and c) Federated analytics with data compliance. Uniquely, this research was designed, implemented, tested and deployed in collaboration with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Santander, RegulAItion and part funded by the InnovateUK RegNet project. I am a co-founder of RegulAItion. \n\n/ Using AI to Automate the Regulatory Handbook: In this investigation we propose the use of reasoning systems for encoding financial regulation as machine readable and executable rules. We argue that our rules-based \u201cwhite-box\u201d approach is needed, as opposed to a \u201cblack-box\u201d machine learning approach, as regulators need explainability and outline the theoretical foundation needed to encode regulation from the FCA Handbook into machine readable semantics. We then present the design and implementation of a production-grade regulatory reasoning system built on top of the Java Expert System Shell (JESS) and use it to encode a subset of regulation (consumer credit regulation) from the FCA Handbook. We then perform an empirical evaluation, with the regulator, of the system based on its performance and accuracy in handling 600 \u201creal- world\u201d queries and compare it with its human equivalent. The findings suggest that the proposed approach of using reasoning systems not only provides quicker responses, but also more accurate results to answers from queries that are explainable. \n\n/ SmartReg: Using Blockchain for Regulatory Reporting: In this investigation we explore the use of distributed ledgers for real-time reporting of data for compliance between firms and regulators. Regulators and firms recognise the growing burden and complexity of regulatory reporting resulting from the lack of data standardisation, increasing complexity of regulation and the lack of machine executable rules. The investigation presents a) the design and implementation of a permissioned Quorum-Ethereum based regulatory reporting network that makes use of an off-chain reporting service to execute machine readable rules on banks\u2019 data through smart contracts b) a means for cross border regulators to share reporting data with each other that can be used to given them a true global view of systemic risk c) a means to carry out regulatory reporting using a novel pull-based approach where the regulator is able to directly \u201cpull\u201d relevant data out of the banks\u2019 environments in an ad-hoc basis- enabling regulators to become more active when addressing risk. We validate the approach and implementation of our system through a pilot use case with a bank and regulator. The outputs of this investigation have informed the Digital Regulatory Reporting initiative- an FCA and UK Government led project to improve regulatory reporting in the financial services. \n\n\n\n/ RegNet: Using Federated Learning and Blockchain for Privacy Preserving Data Access In this investigation we explore the use of Federated Machine Learning and Trusted data access for analytics. With the development of stricter Data Regulation (e.g. GDPR) it is increasingly difficult to share data for collective analytics in a compliant manner. We argue that for data compliance, data does not need to be shared but rather, trusted data access is needed. The investigation presents a) the design and implementation of RegNet- an infrastructure for trusted data access in a secure and privacy preserving manner for a singular algorithmic purpose, where the algorithms (such as Federated Learning) are orchestrated to run within the infrastructure of data owners b) A taxonomy for Federated Learning c) The tokenization and orchestration of Federated Learning through smart contracts for auditable governance. We validate our approach and the infrastructure (RegNet) through a real world use case, involving a number of banks, that makes use of Federated Learning with Epsilon-Differential Privacy for improving the performance of an Anti-Money-Laundering classification model",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive new technology introduced around a decade ago. It can be viewed as a method for recording timestamped transactions in a public database. Most of blockchain protocols do not scale well, i.e., they cannot process quickly large amounts of transactions. A natural idea to deal with this problem is to use the blockchain only as a timestamping service, i.e., to hash several transactions tx 1, . . . , tx m into one short string, and just put this string on the blockchain, while at the same time posting the hashed transactions tx 1, . . . , tx m to some public place on the Internet (\"off-chain\"). In this way the transactions tx i remain timestamped, but the amount of data put on the blockchain is greatly reduced. This idea was introduced in 2017 under the name Plasma by Poon and Buterin. Shortly after this proposal, several variants of Plasma have been proposed. They are typically built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, as they strongly rely on so-called smart contracts (in order to resolve disputes between the users if some of them start cheating). Plasmas are an example of so-called off-chain protocols. In this work we initiate the study of the inherent limitations of Plasma protocols. More concretely, we show that in every Plasma system the adversary can either (a) force the honest parties to communicate a lot with the blockchain, even though they did not intend to (this is traditionally called mass exit); or (b) an honest party that wants to leave the system needs to quickly communicate large amounts of data to the blockchain. What makes these attacks particularly hard to handle in real life is that these attacks do not have so-called uniquely attributable faults, i.e. the smart contract cannot determine which party is malicious, and hence cannot force it to pay the fees for the blockchain interaction. An important implication of our result is that the benefits of two of the most prominent Plasma types, called Plasma Cash and Fungible Plasma, cannot be achieved simultaneously. Besides of the direct implications on real-life cryptocurrency research, we believe that this work may open up a new line of theoretical research, as, up to our knowledge, this is the first work that provides an impossibility result in the area of off-chain protocols.",

        "abstract": "Performance of complex analytics \\& AI algorithms typically involves large amounts of data. The data may originate from multiple sources and is typically compiled and moved to a central location before it can be consumed by the algorithms, making this approach impractical for untrusting organizations interested to share analytics and results but not risking the exposure of the dataset in its entirety. Current approaches to support such a scenario for data consumption is to move the computation closer to the data instead of the other way around. But that involves writing code for distributed file systems like Hadoop File System (HDFS), which demands professional expertise in writing Map-Reduce jobs and parallel code design patterns. In this thesis, we demonstrate a proof of concept allowing organizations to share their datasets for consumption by inter-organizational workflows without exposing the data itself and avoiding distributed programming expertise. We propose an approach using Hyperledger Fabric for untrusting entities to advertise their datasets for consumption by other organizations without demanding extensive knowledge of writing distributed code, and all this without ever exposing the data itself to the user. Hence the analytics can be run on the data while maintaining ownership. A permissioned blockchain network is established using Hyperledger Fabric and organizations can join the mentioned consortium. A JupyterHub server is hosted on a Kubernetes cluster that services users with a Jupyter instance where users can explore the datasets available through our custom extension, write code and construct workflows running the algorithms on the datasets. The required datasets are consumed as persistent volumes when running the workflow; only exposing the data to the job requiring it. To ensure the privacy of sensitive information committed to the blockchain, organizations encrypt the sensitive information with keys that are internal to the organization",

We view\nexperiments today in web3 identity as additive and complementary, and argue\nthat often cited differences are of degree and more in form, less in substance.\nBy way of illustration, we compare decentralized naming services and blockchain\nbased identity certificates such as soulbound tokens (SBTs) to decentralized\nidentifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs). Both paradigms, to the\nextent they can be meaningfully differentiated, share similar potential as well\nas challenges. Specifically, we refer to fears about non consensual\nverification (scarlet letters) and show DID method iterations are not immune by\nissuing an innocuous public scarlet letter to a DIDs associated public address\nfor anyone to see. Moreover, we argue that because SBTs are unspecified, one\ncould characterize SBTs as an iteration, or extension, of VCs that additionally\naspire to achieve composability with web3 smart contracts for correct execution\nof code, privacy, coercion resistance, and censorship resistance. We offer\nresearch paths for how VCs can also achieve these properties. We do not comment\non cost, scalability, transferability, or common knowledge as they have been\npreviously reviewed.",

        "abstract": "In this dissertation, we present an information hiding approach incorporating anonymity that builds on existing classical steganographic models. Current security definitions are not sufficient to analyze the proposed information hiding approach as steganography offers data privacy by hiding the existence of data, a property that is distinct from confidentiality (data existence is known but access is restricted) and authenticity (data existence is known but manipulation is restricted). Combinations of the latter two properties are common in analyses, such as Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), yet there is a lack of research on combinations with steganography. This dissertation also introduces the security definition of Authenticated Stegotext with Associated Data (ASAD), which captures steganographic properties even when there is contextual information provided alongside the hidden data. We develop a hierarchical framework of ASAD variants, corresponding to different channel demands. We present a real-world steganographic embedding scheme, Authenticated SteGotex with Associated tRansaction Data (ASGARD), that leverages a blockchain-based application as a medium for sending hidden data. We analyze ASGARD in our framework  and show that it meets Level-4 ASAD security. Finally,  we implement ASGARD on the Ethereum platform as a proof-of-concept and analyze some of the ways an adversary might detect our embedding activity by analyzing historical Ethereum data.Lieutenant, United States NavyApproved for public release.

While previous research has focused on designing\neffective prompts, in this work, we argue that compared to prompt design, a\ngood mapping strategy matters more. In this sense, we propose SeMap, a more\neffective mapping using the semantic alignment between the pre-trained model's\nknowledge and the downstream task. Our experimental results show that SeMap can\nlargely boost the performance of visual prompt learning. Moreover, our\nexperiments show that SeMap is capable of achieving competitive zero-shot\ntransfer, indicating that it can perform the downstream task without any\nfine-tuning on the corresponding dataset. This demonstrates the potential of\nour proposed method to be used in a broader range of applications where the\nzero-shot transfer is desired. Results suggest that our proposed SeMap could\nlead to significant advancements in both visual prompt learning and zero-shot\ntransfer. We hope with SeMap, we can help the community move forward to more\nefficient and lightweight utilization of large vision models.",

This work takes a different approach by combining large-scale\nstatistical techniques with publicly available blockchain data in order to\nanswer previously intractable questions. The crux of our analysis technique is\nbased on the simple observation that some miners can utilize their hashpower\nmore efficiently due to their position in the network. By teasing out that\neffect, we de-bias the mining power distribution to get a more accurate\nestimate. Using that de-biased mining power distribution, we can answer\nquestions about the network position of miners in each cryptocurrency network.\nFinally, during the course of this study, we observed some unusual mining\nbehaviors which we highlight.",

We analyze the protocol's security by a threat model and design a robust delegation mechanism based on triple Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) proxy signature. We implement Baguena and evaluate its performance on 100 Amazon EC2 virtual machines simulating 50k users, which shows that Baguena confirms transactions in 2 minutes, achieves 2.16\u00d7 of Algorand's throughput and 6.95\u00d7 of Ouroboros' throughput.",

        "abstract": "The blockchain is a ledger of accounts and transactions that are written and stored by all participants. It promises a reliable source of truth about the state of farms, inventories and contracts in agriculture, where the collection of such information is often incredibly costly. The blockchain technology can track the provenance of food and thus helps create trustworthy food supply chains and build trust between producers and consumers. As a trusted way of storing data, it facilitates the use of data-driven technologies to make farming smarter. In addition, jointly used with smart contracts, it allows timely payments between stakeholders that can be triggered by data changes appearing in the blockchain This article examines the applications of blockchain technology in food supply chains, agricultural insurance, smart farming, transactions of agricultural products for both theoretical and practical perspectives. We also discuss the challenges of recording transactions made by smallholder farmers and creating the ecosystem for utilizing the blockchain technology in the food and agriculture sector.",

The changing needs of the civilization currently demands a\npractical yet secure electronic voting system, but any flaw related to the\napplied voting technology can lead to tampering of the results with the\nmalicious outcomes. Currently, blockchain technology due to its transparent\nstructure forms an emerging area of investigation for the development of voting\nsystems with a far greater security. However, various apprehensions are yet to\nbe conclusively resolved before using blockchain in high stakes elections.\nOther than this, the blockchain based voting systems are vulnerable to possible\nattacks by upcoming noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computer. To\ncircumvent, most of these limitations, in this work, we propose an anonymous\nvoting scheme based on quantum assisted blockchain by enhancing the advantages\noffered by blockchain with the quantum resources such as quantum random number\ngenerators and quantum key distribution. The purposed scheme is shown to\nsatisfy the requirements of a good voting scheme. Further, the voting scheme is\nauditable and can be implemented using the currently available technology.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain relay schemes enable cross-chain state proofs without requiring trusted intermediaries. This is achieved by applying the source blockchain\u2019s consensus validation protocol on the target blockchain. Existing chain relays allow for the validation of blocks created using the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol. Since PoW entails high energy consumption, limited throughput, and no guaranteed finality, Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols are increasingly popular for addressing these shortcomings. We propose Verilay, the first chain relay scheme that enables validating PoS protocols that produce finalized blocks, for example, Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, and Polkadot. The concept does not require changes to the source blockchain protocols or validator operations. Signatures of block proposers are validated by a dedicated relay smart contract on the target blockchain. In contrast to basic PoW chain relays, Verilay requires only a subset of block headers to be submitted in order to maintain full verifiability. This yields enhanced scalability. We provide a prototypical implementation that facilitates the validation of Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain headers within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Our evaluation proves the applicability to Ethereum 1.0\u2019s mainnet and confirms that only a fraction of transaction costs are required compared to PoW chain relay updates.",

A successful implementation of blockchain as backbone of existing information technology systems is bound to eliminate various types of fraud and ensure quicker delivery of the item on trade. To adapt IT systems to blockchain architecture, an efficient consensus algorithm need to be designed. Blockchain based on proof of work first came up as the backbone of cryptocurrency.

An appropriate linkage structure is defined so that it becomes possible to simultaneously work on various stages of different blocks. The overall effect is an improvement in the transaction processing rate and the time for confirming a transaction. These are achieved without compromising on security. The division of the proof-of-work into several stages also divides the block reward into an equal number of stage rewards. Once a block gets onto the blockchain, the miner which successfully completed a particular stage can claim the reward for that stage. This ensures a more equitable distribution of the reward for successfully mining a block.",

        "abstract": "Due to the open-source nature of the blockchain ecosystem, it is common for\nnew blockchains to fork or partially reuse the code of classic blockchains. For\nexample, the popular Dogecoin, Litecoin, Binance BSC, and Polygon are all\nvariants of Bitcoin/Ethereum. These \"forked\" blockchains thus could encounter\nsimilar vulnerabilities that are propagated from Bitcoin/Ethereum during\nforking or subsequently commit fetching. In this paper, we conduct a systematic\nstudy of detecting and investigating the propagated vulnerabilities in forked\nblockchain projects. To facilitate this study, we propose BlockScope, a novel\ntool that can effectively and efficiently detect multiple types of cloned\nvulnerabilities given an input of existing Bitcoin/Ethereum security patches.\nSpecifically, BlockScope adopts similarity-based code match and designs a new\nway of calculating code similarity to cover all the syntax-wide variant (i.e.,\nType-1, Type-2, and Type-3) clones. Moreover, BlockScope automatically extracts\nand leverages the contexts of patch code to narrow down the search scope and\nlocate only potentially relevant code for comparison. Our evaluation shows that\nBlockScope achieves good precision and high recall both at 91.8% (1.8 times\nhigher recall than that in ReDeBug). BlockScope allows us to discover 101\npreviously unknown vulnerabilities in 13 out of the 16 forked projects of\nBitcoin and Ethereum, including 16 from Dogecoin, 6 from Litecoin, 1 from\nBinance, and 4 from Optimism. We have reported all the vulnerabilities to their\ndevelopers; 40 of them have been patched or accepted, 66 were acknowledged or\nunder pending, and only 4 were rejected. We further investigate the propagation\nand patching processes of discovered vulnerabilities, and reveal three types of\nvulnerability propagation from source to forked projects, as well as the long\ndelay (over 200 days) for releasing patches in Bitcoin forks.",

Usage of a blockchain-based ledger is\nhighly impactful in terms of security of a banking organization.\nBlockchain-based currency tokens, also referred to as Cryptocurrencies are not\nregulated by the government, highly volatile, and anonymous to use.\nFurthermore, there is no security for any funds invested in a cryptocurrency\nmarket. However, the integration of a blockchain ledger in a traditional\nbanking organization would strengthen the security to provide more stability\nand confidence to its customers and at the same time, make blockchain a more\nreliable method to consider due to being trusted by large financial\norganizations.",

However, despite compelling evidence and a range of suggested solutions, transnational coordination of effective measures to protect our biosphere continues to fall short. To remedy, we propose a novel platform for addressing the central issue of affording trust, transparency and truth while minimizing administrative overheads. This will empower an even loosely organized, global grass-roots community to coordinate a large-scale project on a shared goal (\u201cCommons\u201d) spanning the digital and real world. The Web3 concept is based on the swiftly emerging \u201cBlockchain\u201d and related cryptographic, distributed and permissionless technologies. \u201cWisdom of the crowds\u201d mechanisms involving competitive parallelization and prediction markets are enabled by formalized reputation and staking to incentivize high-quality work, fair validation and best management practice. While these mechanisms have been (mostly separately) applied to science, business, governance, web, sensor, information and communication technologies (ICT), our integrative approach around Blockchain-enabled \u2018operating principles and protocols\u2019 sets the basis for designing novel forms of potentially crowdfunded Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).",

Verifying the transformation to a nuclear-weapon-free world (NWFW) is an adaptive, multi-stage process, involving various mechanisms and tasks for nuclear and non-nuclear weapon States, and monitoring a wide range of items and activities for increasing or decreasing nuclear weapons capability. Whether States find the Treaty verifiable depends on the available capabilities, but also on political assumptions and requirements. Verification plays an important role in the transformation towards a NWFW to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in a hostile environment where uncertainties are seen as threatening. Verification also helps to establish a viable international security landscape based on cooperation and trust that is able to address the complex implementation issues of nuclear weapons prohibition and elimination.",

Of the multiple vulnerabilities that exist in Web application software, proper authentication of the client and the server to each other is fundamental to the security of the system. In the current scenario, we manage this with the adoption of password-based client authentication and PKI-based server authentication. There exist unresolved vulnerabilities in this system due to the misuse of the client's passwords (impersonation) by those managing the servers. The clients' trust of the server based on the certificates issued by an increasing number of certification authorities is questionable in terms of validity and freshness. For proper authentication in Web applications, we need to verify two conditions: 1) the binding of the identity of the entity with the publicly known name or key and 2) the entity does possess the corresponding private key for the identified public key. In this paper, we use the elliptic curve discrete log problem-based version of classical zero knowledge protocol for proving number 2 and modifications of the existing schemes for proving number 1. We have done a prototype implementation of the solution and security analysis required to satisfy the security objectives.",

We attempt to break the \"hype cycle\" portraying blockchain's superiority by navigating a rational blockchain use case development approach. By prototyping an SDG Acceleration Scorecard to use blockchain-enabled solutions as SDG accelerators, we aim to provide useful insights towards developing an integrated approach that is fit-for-purpose to guide organizations and practitioners in their quest to make informed decisions to design and implement blockchain-backed solutions as SDG accelerators. Acknowledging the limitations in prototyping such tools, we believe these are minimally viable products and should be considered as living tools that can further evolve as the blockchain technology matures, its pace of adoption increases, lessons are learned, and good practices and standards are widely shared and internalized by teams and organizations working on innovation for development.",

For example, machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis may rely on the correctness of ontologies and could potentially deliver false results. For enhancing trust, we developed a WebProt\u00e9g\u00e9 plugin for the decentralized attestation and verification to the integrity and validity of ontologies using the Ethereum blockchain. Blockchains are an immutable, tamper-resistant and decentralized storage where all transactions are digitally signed.

In the literature, a number of verifiable remote voting schemes have been introduced recently. However, some of these schemes are only suitable for the low coercion environment. Since without the receipt-freeness guarantee, voters can be coerced or bribed to vote the candidate favoured by adversaries. Some other schemes provide a very high level of security assurance, e.g. coercion resistance, but these schemes are normally very complex, and ordinary voters are required to perform complicated crypto calculations. In this study, the authors introduce a generic framework for practical and receipt-free remote voting. In their proposed scheme, voters do not need to have special knowledge or use any trusted device to cast their votes, and meanwhile, they cannot prove to the others how they have voted.",

        "abstract": "Information assets are one of the most valuable intangible productive capital for a company to compete with its rivals, to learn consumers\u2019 shopping habits, to guide its development directions, and to standout to retain its profitability. However, with the Internet\u2019s characteristic of pervasiveness, information breaches from both external hacking and internal corruption are continuously encroaching a company\u2019s economic profit. This dissertation consists of three studies where each study investigates the different aspects of information security, and it is aimed to address the growing concern of securing a company\u2019s information assets. The first study examines the external hackers\u2019 behaviors and models a Bayesian game between a firm and two discrete types of hackers (domestic and international) based on the framework of Inspection Game. This study explains why external hackings, especially the international ones, are hard to prevent effectively. The second study is an empirical work and explores the other side of information security data breach, which is mainly due to insiders\u2019 (e.g., employee) malicious deeds or noncompliance with information security policy. This study shows that individual reward and punishment together with 100% detection is the best incentive structure to reduce insider data breaches. In addition, the second study finds that individual reward is more effective than individual punishment, which can better explain why employees are more willing to spend time to comply with security policy when a reward is present. Lastly, the third study is a conceptual work and relies on the Theory of Bounded Rationality to discuss how the Blockchain technology can undermine the motivations of both external and internal intruders in order to prevent information breaches. Overall, this dissertation discusses the current issues of hacking, constructs a payment/incentive structure to regulate noncompliance, empirically tests the validity of the proposed structure, points out a solution to advance information security defense, and provides some managerial recommendations to practitioners",

        "abstract": "First come, first served: Critical choices between alternative actions are often made based on events external to an organization, and reacting promptly to their occurrence can be a major advantage over the competition. In Business Process Management (BPM), such deferred choices can be expressed in process models, and they are an important aspect of process engines. Blockchain-based process execution approaches are no exception to this, but are severely limited by the inherent properties of the platform: The isolated environment prevents direct access to external entities and data, and the non-continual runtime based entirely on atomic transactions impedes the monitoring and detection of events. In this paper we provide an in-depth examination of the semantics of deferred choice, and transfer them to environments such as the blockchain. We introduce and compare several oracle architectures able to satisfy certain requirements, and show that they can be implemented using state-of-the-art blockchain technology.",

This requires great care because of the additional\nliberty in freshness checking allowed by the use of Skolem terms. In contrast\nto semantic soundness, we gain the possibility to state a cut elimination\ntheorem for sequent calculus, under the proviso that completeness of the method\nholds.

        "abstract": "The Distributed Auditing Proofs of Liabilities (DAPOL) are schemes designed to let companies that accept (i) monetary deposits from consumers (i.e., custodial wallets, blockchain exchanges, banks, gambling industry etc.) or (ii) fungible obligations and report claims from users (i.e., daily reporting of COVID-19 cases , negative product reviews, unemployment rate, disapproval voting etc.) to prove their total amount of liabilities or obligations without compromising the privacy of both users\u2019 identity and individual amounts. Throughout this document we\u2019ll often refer to one of DAPOL\u2019s most popular use cases, which is proving solvency of cryptocurrency exchanges. Solvency is defined as the ability of a company to meet its long-term financial commitments. In finance and particularly in blockchain systems, proof of solvency consists of two components: 1. Proof of liabilities: proving the total quantity of coins the exchange owes to all of its customers. 2. Proof of reserves (also known as proof of assets): proving ownership of digital assets (i.e., coins) in the blockchain. Typically, an exchange should prove that the total balance of owned coins is greater than or equal to their liabilities, which correspond to the sum of coins their users own internally to their platform. It is highlighted that this proposal focuses on the proofs of liabilities part only, mainly because the same solution can be applied to a broad range of applications, even outside solvency, and secondly because the proof of assets part cannot easily be generalized and it differs between blockchain types due to different privacy guarantees offered per platform [14; 18; 30; 31]. The extra benefit of DAPOL compared to conventional auditor-based approaches is it provides a transparent mechanism for users to validate their balance inclusion in the reported total amount of liabilities/obligations and complements the traditional validation performed by the auditors by adding extra privacy guarantees. This document focuses on a particular class of auditing cases, in which we assume that the audited entity does not have any incentive to increase its liabilities or obligations. Although proofs of liabilities are an essential part of proving financial solvency, it will be shown that there are numerous applications of DAPOL, including their use in tax earning statements, \u201cnegative\u201d voting and transparent reports of offensive content in social networks, among the others. The recommended approach combines previously known cryptographic techniques to provide a layered solution with predefined levels of privacy in the form of gadgets. The backbone of this proposal is based on the enhanced Maxwell\u2019s Merkle-tree construction and is extended using balance splitting tricks, efficient padding, verifiable random functions, deterministic key derivation functions and the range proof techniques from Provisions and ZeroLedge solvency protocols, respectively. Because Bulletproofs [5], Gro16 [23], Ligero [1], Plonk [21], Halo [3] and other efficient ZKP constructions were not available or mature when the above solvency protocols were published, we will assume that any efficient zero knowledge scheme for set membership in summation structures can be a good candidate, but we hope we will agree as a community on one or two concrete constructions.",

        "abstract": "As an important method of making democratic decisions, voting has always been a topic of social concern. Compared with the traditional, e-voting is widely used in various decision scenarios because of the convenience, easy to participate and low cost. However, the proposed e-voting protocols are at the risk of excessive authority and tampered information, which makes it impossible to achieve true fairness and transparency in e-voting. By combining the blockchain technology, it enables to solve these problems with the decentralization and tamper-resistant features. Moreover, the misoperations of the voters will also affect this fairness, such as voting for non-candidates, abstention or repeated voting. Therefore, to ensure the efficiency of the voting process and maintain the fairness of the voting environment, it is important to append the function of audit in e-voting protocol. This paper proposes an e-voting protocol based on blockchain, which provides transparency in the process of voting. At the same time, this scheme has the ability to audit voters operating incorrectly and resist quantum attacks by adopting the certificateless and code-based cryptography. After performance analysis, our scheme is suitable for the small-scale election and has some advantages in security and efficiency when the number of voters is small.

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AV) utilize various machine learning (ML) models for performing tasks such as pedestrian detection, charging station prediction, routing path prediction, intrusion detection, to name a few. To improve the robustness of such applications, decentralized collaboration is imperative in a vehicular network. Moreover, decentralized collaboration poses threats, such as forged message injection, forged identity, and repudiatory activities, as most vehicles are stranger to each other. In recent years, blockchain technology has been widely used in the vehicular network to enhance trust, provenance, and eliminate unauthorized access to the vehicular services. However, most of the existing vehicular blockchain suffers from issues related to scalability, efficiency, and transaction verification. In this paper, we propose a lightweight vehicular blockchain architecture for distributed model sharing to enhance trust, verifiability, and non-repudiation in distributed vehicular collaboration. We propose a novel PoVS-BFT protocol and an effective two-step transaction verification mechanism for model sharing applications. Finally, simulation results are presented to conform to the efficacy of our proposed architecture. Simulation results show that the proposed PoVS-BFT protocol can minimize the size of consensus committee up to 62.5% which in turn reduces communication complexity during the consensus process.",

We further\nestablish that our model belongs to a class of network models, called monotone\nseparable models. This allows us to establish upper and lower bounds on the\nstability region. The bounds on stability depend on the connectivity of the P2P\nnetwork through its conductance and allow us to analyze the scalability of\nblockchain systems on large P2P networks.

The research was conducted using a qualitative approach, namely the User Center Design (UCD). The results of a business model created based on blockchain technology are then validated in one of the largest pharmaceutical industries in Indonesia, which consists of 5 experts from various fields. Validation is carried out by means of a Forum Group Discussion. The final result of the FGD states that the drug manufacturing process business model with blockchain technology is suitable and can be used by the drug industry.

These properties make blockchain an ideal candidate to solve the existing problems in digital vaccination. In this paper, we propose a novel block-chain-based system, namely BlockVac, to implement a UAIVS. Furthermore, our work provides a way to track an individual's and family's vaccination history, which is essential for scientific research and development. BlockVac is highly modular, sealable, and cost-efficient, providing enough room for future feature additions. The current works lack cost and scalability analysis. We show the scalability of our system through a thorough analysis. Our implementation shows that adding one vaccination record costs $7.16828\\times 10^{-6}$ ETH $(\\sim 0.026\\text{USD})$ for registration, $2.5089\\times 10^{-5}$ ETH $(\\sim 0.078\\text{USD})$ for vaccination, and the system can easily handle up to 20K vaccinations per hour.",

        "abstract": "Smart contract platforms facilitate the development of important and diverse\ndistributed applications in a simple manner. This simplicity stems from the\ninherent utility of employing the state of smart contracts to store, query and\nverify the validity of application data. In Ethereum, data storage incurs an\nunderpriced, non-recurring, predefined fee. Furthermore, as there is no\nincentive for freeing or minimizing the state of smart contracts, Ethereum is\nfaced with a tragedy of the commons problem with regards to its monotonically\nincreasing state. This issue, if left unchecked, may lead to centralization and\ndirectly impact Ethereum's security and longevity. In this work, we introduce\nan alternative paradigm for developing smart contracts in which their state is\nof constant size and facilitates the verification of application data that are\nstored to and queried from an external, potentially unreliable, storage\nnetwork. This approach is relevant for a wide range of applications, such as\nany key-value store. We evaluate our approach by adapting the most widely\ndeployed standard for fungible tokens, i.e., the ERC20 token standard. We show\nthat Ethereum's current cost model penalizes our approach, even though it\nminimizes the overhead to Ethereum's state and aligns well with Ethereum's\nfuture. We address Ethereum's monotonically increasing state in a two-fold\nmanner. First, we introduce recurring fees that are proportional to the state\nof smart contracts and adjustable by the miners that maintain the network.\nSecond, we propose a scheme where the cost of storage-related operations\nreflects the effort that miners have to expend to execute them. Lastly, we show\nthat under such a pricing scheme that encourages economy in the state consumed\nby smart contracts, our ERC20 token adaptation reduces the incurred transaction\nfees by up to an order of magnitude.Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures, DAPPCON 201",

        "abstract": "While quantitative automation related to trading cryptoassets such as ERC-20 tokens has become relatively commonplace, with services such as 3Commas and Shrimpy offering user-friendly web-driven services for even the average crypto trader, not the mention the specialist, we have not yet seen the emergence of on-chain trading as a phenomenon. We hypothesize that just like decentralized exchanges (DEXes) that by now are by some measures more popular than traditional exchanges, process in the space of decentralized finance (DeFi) may enable attractive online trading automation options. In this paper we present ChainBot, an approach for creating algorithmic trading bots with the help of blockchain technology. We show how to partition the algorithmic computation into onand off-chain components in a way that provides a measure of end-to-end integrity, while preserving the algorithmic \u201csecret sauce\u201d. The end result is a system where an enduser can sign-up for the services of a trading bot, with trust established via on-chain publicly readable contracts. Our system is enabled with a careful use of algorithm partitioning and zero-knowledge proofs together with standard smart contracts available on most modern blockchains. Our approach offers more transparent access to liquidity and better censorship-resistance compared to traditional off-chain trading approaches both for cryptoand more traditional assets. We show that the end-to-end costs and execution times are affordable for regular use and that gas costs can be successfully amortized because trading strategies are executed on behalf of large user pools. Finally, we show that with modern layer-2 (L2) technologies, trades issued by the trading bot can be kept private, which means that algorithmic parameters are difficult to recover by a chain observer. With ChainBot, we develop a sample trading bot and train it on historical data, resulting in returns that are up to 2.4\u00d7 and on average 1.4\u00d7 the buy-and-hold strategy, which we use as our baseline. Our measurements show that across 1000 runs, the end-to-end average execution time for our system is 48.4 seconds. We demonstrate that the frequency of trading does not significantly affect the rate of return and Sharpe ratio, which indicates that we do not have to trade at every block, thereby significantly saving in terms of gas fees. In our implementation, a user who invests $1,000 would earn $105, and spend $3 on gas; assuming a user pool of 1,000 subscribers.",

        "abstract": "The new \"status quo\" created by the emerging integration of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) and Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructures, combined with the openness of the 5G service market, have set new standards on how the multitude of 5G service domains should be incentivized and coordinated to comply with the performance requirements set on a per session basis. In this paper, we revisit the predominant offline contract-driven mobile data access model enabling users to gain access to the infrastructure of only a few network operators and propose a new blockchain-backed mobile data access model where the key 5G stakeholders can trade, share and consume mobile edge network assets (access to the internet, spectrum, processing, storage, local content etc.) in a fully decentralized, anonymous and highly-robust fashion. Blockchain-backed mobile data access should address critical practical challenges of blockchain decentralization, scalability and security in the context of 5G and Beyond networks. Accordingly, we provide a meticulous survey of existing solutions in the aforementioned three areas and present a comprehensive holistic framework of protocols to address the key challenges identified, including a delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for distributed blockchain consensus over 5G and Beyond mobile data networks, a future-proof smart-contract enabled payment relay service enabling instant off-chain payments in a highly robust fashion as well as a hybrid mixing protocol that enables payment relays to act as anonymous payment hubs while addressing the unique challenges opposed by the joint blockchain and network level interaction of the 5G and Beyond service components.A wide range of practical implications and mitigation measures for dishonest operation of the blockchain nodes are investigated and sophisticated yet highly-robust incentive engineering mechanisms are derived. Detailed numerical results also accompany the paper, bringing to light the unique performance trade-offs and valuable design guidelines towards blockchain-backed mobile data access for 5G and Beyond mobile data networks.

However, these traditional chatbot architectures depend heavily on natural language processing (NLP), it is not feasible to implement for the languages with little to no prior NLP backbone. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised artificially intelligent chatbot framework that can automate parts of primary interaction and customer service. The primary focus of this work is to build a chatbot which can generate contextualized responses in any language without depending much on rich NLP background and a vast number of a prior data set. This system is designed in such a way that with a dictionary of a language and regular customer interaction dataset, it can provide customer services for any business in any language. This architecture has been used to build a customer service bot for an electric shop, and different analysis has been done to evaluate the performance of individual components of the framework to show its competence to provide reliable response generation in comparison with other approaches.",

        "abstract": "Although large language models have achieved impressive zero-shot ability,\nthe huge model size generally incurs high cost. Recently, semi-parametric\nlanguage models, which augment a smaller language model with an external\nretriever, have demonstrated promising language modeling capabilities. However,\nit remains unclear whether such semi-parametric language models can perform\ncompetitively well as their fully-parametric counterparts on zero-shot\ngeneralization to downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce $\\text{Zemi}$, a\nzero-shot semi-parametric language model. To our best knowledge, this is the\nfirst semi-parametric language model that can demonstrate strong zero-shot\nperformance on a wide range of held-out unseen tasks. We train $\\text{Zemi}$\nwith a novel semi-parametric multitask prompted training paradigm, which shows\nsignificant improvement compared with the parametric multitask training as\nproposed by T0. Specifically, we augment the multitask training and zero-shot\nevaluation with retrieval from a large-scale task-agnostic unlabeled corpus. In\norder to incorporate multiple potentially noisy retrieved augmentations, we\nfurther propose a novel $\\text{augmentation fusion}$ module leveraging\nperceiver resampler and gated cross-attention. Notably, our proposed\n$\\text{Zemi}_\\text{LARGE}$ outperforms T0-3B by 16% on all seven evaluation\ntasks while being 3.9x smaller in model size.",

        "abstract": "Today's cities face numerous challenges due to climate change and urbanization. The concept of a smart city aims to help cities to address these challenges by adapting modern information and communication technology. Smart mobility and transportation form one important aspect of smart cities. Inefficient mobility in cities can lead to problems such as traffic congestion, which results in frustration for residents and a decrease in the quality of life. Against the backdrop of global warming, cities also strive to reduce CO2 emissions, an attempt which requires sustainable and novel mobility concepts. Blockchain is a current technology, said to have huge potential, that is being investigated for application in many facets of smart cities. In the context of smart mobility, blockchain can be used for transactions relating to ridesharing and electric charging, handling of interactions of platoon members, or serving as a foundation for communication between vehicles. Although initial research about this topic exists, it is distributed among different use-cases and applications. This article conducts a systematic literature review to analyze blockchain's role in mobility and transportation in smart cities, and its potential to increase efficiency in these areas. With this review, we aim to consolidate and summarize the current knowledge about this topic. As a first result, we present the findings from our literature review, which can be divided into five categories of use-cases. We also present a platform for further research about this emerging topic by identifying promising future research avenues. For this purpose, we derive a future research agenda based on our findings.",

Over the past five years, there has been significant growth in the amount of academic literature examining how these local energy markets might function. This systematic literature review of 139 peer-reviewed journal articles examines the market designs used in these energy trading models. A modified version of the Business Ecosystem Architecture Modelling framework is used to extract market model information from the literature, and to identify differences and similarities between the models. This paper examines how peer-to-peer, community self-consumption and transactive energy markets are described in current literature. It explores the similarities and differences between these markets in terms of participation, governance structure, topology, and design. This paper systematises peer-to-peer, community self-consumption and transactive energy market designs, identifying six archetypes. Finally, it identifies five evidence gaps which require future research before these markets could be widely adopted. These evidence gaps are the lack of: consideration of physical constraints; a holistic approach to market design and operation; consideration about how these market designs will scale; consideration of information security; and, consideration of market participant privacy",

Therefore, organizations proposed the application of blockchain technology to interconnect the different actors and increase tax transparency.

Especially, businesses are concerned about the disclosure of commercially sensitive information that might threaten their competitive advantage. In this paper, we investigate how the application of zero-knowledge-proofs can contribute to solving the dilemma between transparency and confidentiality in blockchain-based tax systems. To meet this end, we provide a conceptual design of a confidentiality-preserving distributed tax ledger. Moreover, we present a prototype addressing reporting obligations in the context of value-added tax. Our evaluation shows that zero-knowledge proofs are an effective measure to trade off transparency against confidentiality. Still, their application is challenging and future research must focus on better abstractions of proving statements.",

In this demonstration, we present SimBlock, a blockchain network simulator. It simulates the peer-to-peer network of a public blockchain, e.g., Bitcoin, which consists of thousands of nodes, as well as parameters related to a blockchain and its network are flexibly configurable. SimBlock can also visualize nodes\u2019 behavior and block propagation. By giving some example studies, such as exploring better neighbor selection strategies and assessing the influence of relay networks, we show that SimBlock can facilitate blockchain network research.",

        "abstract": "We focus on securely computing the ranks of sealed integers distributed among n parties. For example, we securely compute the largest or smallest integer, the median, or in general the k th -ranked integer. Such computations are a useful building block to securely implement a variety of sealed-bid auctions. Our objective is efficiency, specifically low interactivity between parties to support blockchains or other scenarios where multiple rounds are time-consuming. Hence, we dismiss powerful, yet highlyinteractive MPC frameworks and propose BOREALIS, a special-purpose protocol for secure computation of ranks among integers. BOREALIS uses additively homomorphic encryption to implement core comparisons, but computes under distinct keys, chosen by each party to optimize the number of rounds. By carefully combining cryptographic primitives, such as ECC Elgamal encryption, encrypted comparisons, ciphertext blinding, secret sharing, and shuffling, BOREALIS sets up systems of multi-scalar equations which we efficiently prove with Groth-Sahai ZK proofs. Therewith, BOREALIS implements a multi-party computation of pairwise comparisons and rank zero-knowledge proofs secure against malicious adversaries. BOREALIS completes in at most 4 rounds which is constant in both bit length of integers and the number of parties n. This is not only asymptotically optimal, but surpasses generic constant-round secure multi-party computation protocols, even those based on shared-key fully homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, our implementation shows that BOREALIS is very practical. Its main bottleneck, ZK proof computations, is small in practice. Even for a large number of parties (n = 200) and high-precision integers ( = 32), computation time of all proofs is less than a single Bitcoin block interval.",

A Prover can further demonstrate knowledge of a secret input that causes the Verifier\u2019s program to satisfy certain assertions, without ever revealing which input was used. State-of-the-art Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (ZKPK) methods encode a computation using arithmetic circuits and preserve the privacy of Prover\u2019s inputs while attesting the integrity of program execution. Nevertheless, developing, debugging, and optimizing programs as circuits remains a daunting task, as most users are unfamiliar with this programming paradigm. In this work, we present Zilch, a framework that accelerates and simplifies the deployment of VC and ZKPK for any application transparently, i.e., without the need of trusted setup. Zilch uses traditional instruction sequences rather than static arithmetic circuits that would need to be regenerated for each different computation. Towards that end, we have implemented Z MIPS: a MIPS-like processor model that allows verifying each instruction independently and compose a proof for the execution of the target application. To foster usability, Zilch incorporates a novel cross-compiler from an object-oriented Java-like language tailored to ZKPK and optimized our Z MIPS model, as well as a powerful API that enables integration of ZKPK within existing C/C++ programs. In our experiments, we demonstrate the flexibility of Zilch using two real-life applications, and evaluate Prover and Verifier performance on a variety of benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "The current landscape of the core Internet technologies shows considerable\ncentralisation with the big tech companies controlling the vast majority of\ntraffic and services. This has sparked a wide range of decentralisation\ninitiatives with perhaps the most profound and successful being the blockchain\ntechnology. In the past years, a core Internet infrastructure, domain name\nsystem (DNS), is being revised mainly due to its inherent security and privacy\nissues. One of the proposed panaceas is Blockchain-based DNS, which claims to\nsolve many issues of traditional DNS. However, this does not come without\nsecurity concerns and issues, as any introduction and adoption of a new\ntechnology does - let alone a disruptive one such as blockchain. In this work,\nwe discuss a number of associated threats, including emerging ones, and we\nvalidate many of them with real-world data. In this regard, we explore a part\nof the blockchain DNS ecosystem in terms of the browser extensions using such\ntechnologies, the chain itself (Namecoin and Emercoin), the domains, and users\nwhich have been registered in both platforms. Finally, we provide some\ncountermeasures to address the identified threats, and we propose a fertile\ncommon ground for further research.",

In Business\nProcess Management (BPM), such deferred choices can be expressed in process\nmodels, and they are an important aspect of process engines.

In this paper we provide an in-depth examination of the\nsemantics of deferred choice, and transfer them to environments such as the\nblockchain.

The proof can be based on any bit commitment scheme with a particular set of properties. We suggest an efficient implementation based on factoring. We also present a 4-move perfect zero-knowledge interactive argument for any NPlanguage L. On input x \u2208 L, the communication complexity is O(|x|c) \u00b7 max(k, l) bits, where l is the security parameter for the prover 1. Again, the protocol can be based on any bit commitment scheme with a particular set of properties. We suggest efficient implementations based on discrete logarithms or factoring. We present an application of our techniques to multiparty computations, allowing for example t committed oblivious transfers with error probability 2\u2212k to be done simultaneously using O(t+k) commitments. Results for general computations follow from this. As a function of the security parameters, our protocols have the smallest known asymptotic communication complexity among general proofs or arguments for NP. Moreover, the constants involved are small enough for the protocols to be practical in a realistic situation: both protocols are based on a Boolean formula \u03a6 containing and, orand not-operators which verifies an NP-witness of membership in L. Let n be the number of times this formula reads an input variable. Then the communication complexity of the protocols when using our concrete commitment schemes can be more precisely stated as at most 4n + k + 1 commitments for the interactive proof and at most 5nl+ 5l bits for the argument (assuming k \u2264 l). Thus, if we use k = n, the number of commitments required for the proof is linear in n. Both protocols are also proofs of knowledge of an NP-witness of membership in the language involved. \u2217Basic Research in Computer Science, Centre of the Danish National Research Foundation. 1The meaning of l is that if the prover is unable to solve an instance of a hard problem of size l before the protocol is finished, he can cheat with probability at most 2\u2212k",

Similarly, there is an increasing interest in adopting blockchain as a new solution to addressing educational credentialing problems. However, none of the existing blockchain initiatives in educational credentialing seems to meet their original goal of global adoption. Based on the Australian tertiary education credentialing industry, this paper presents an abstract credentialing workflow and involved stakeholders, identifies six practical problems in the industry, and proposes five desired attributes of ideal credentials infrastructure. In addition, the paper presents a layered framework for evaluating seven blockchain-based education projects, and provides insights into factors hindering the wide adoption of these blockchain solutions. Finally, we suggest future considerations for the application development of blockchain-based education solutions.",

        "abstract": "Quadratic residuosity and graph isomorphism are classic problems and the canonical examples of zero-knowledge languages. However, despite much research effort, all previous zero-knowledge proofs for them required either unproven complexity assumptions or an unbounded number of rounds of message exchange. For both (and similar) languages, we exhibit zeroknowledge proofs that require 5 rounds and no unproven assumptions. Our solution is essentially optimal, in this setting, due to a recent lower bound argument of Goldreich and Krawczyk. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Interactive proofs and especially zero-knowledge ones have found many applications, most notably in the field of secure protocols. In all such proofs, interaction is the crucial resource, as prover and verifier exchange messages in rounds. The fundamental problem here is whether the number of rounds induces a hierarchy. Tha t is, can we prove more languages in zero knowledge given more rounds? In a cryptographic sett ing the answer is no. But little is known for perfect zero-knowledge proofs. These are the ones tha t can be proven to be zero-knowledge without making use of unproven complexity assumptions. For this reason, perfect zero-knowledge is the right context for studying the intrinsic properties of this notion. There is a gap in what we are able to prove about perfect Zero-Knowledge (ZK): Goldreich and Krawczyk [3] * Suppo r t ed in pa r t by NSF g ran t CCR-87-19689. t S u p p o r t e d in pa r t by NSF g ran t DCR-84-13577 a n d A R O g ran t DAALO3-86-K-0171 .

On the other hand, the classic examples for perfect zero-knowledge, the languages of quadratic residuosity and graph isomorphism, required an unbounded number of rounds. In this paper we show T h e o r e m The languages of graph isomorphism and quadratic residuosity have 5 round perfect zero knowledge interactive proofs. More generally, we show that any random self-reducible language [7] has a 5 round perfect zero knowledge interactive proof. Perfect zero-knowledge works by carefully exploiting the structure of the problem at hand. It is important not only in practice (where we do not know which functions are one-way), but also in a theoretical setting. For example, our best way to prove that a language L, for which no efficient algorithm is known, is not NPcomplete involves exhibiting a perfect zero-knowledge proof for it [2]. Let us now see, at a very high level, why achieving perfect ZK in constant rounds is hard. Essentially, in a ZK proof, the confidence that a theorem is true is transferred by discrete amounts , or tokens. Each token consists of an elementary protocol that decreases the probabil i ty of error by a factor of, say, 2. Thus, after k tokens have been exchanged, this probabil i ty will be reduced to 2 -k . Tokens can be exchanged sequentially or in parallel ( that is concurrently). The ZK constraint implies that the messages exchanged for a single token can be simulated in expected polynomial time. Tha t is, a probabilistic, efficient simulator can output a token in expected, say, 2 trials without any intervention of the prover, and knowing nothing about the proof. Thus, if the proof transfers tokens one at a time, it is easy for the simulator to generate the view relative to k of them: in expected two trials the simulator will output a \"good\" first token; after that , in expected two more trials, will output a second \"good\" token, and so on. Thus, overall, the entire view of the protocol can be \u00a9 1990 ACM 089791-361-2/90/0005/0482 $1.50 482 simulated in expected 2k trials. If, however, the prover transfers tokens \"all together,\" the job of the simulator is much harder: the expected number of trials so that all k of them are simultaneously \"good,\" is 2 k. This phenomenon which will be made more precise in the context of graph isomorphism is what defeated researchers ever since ZK came about. The main result of this paper is a technique for squeezing the number of rounds in a interactive proof, while preserving simulatability. The proof of our main theorem involves several new ideas; in particular, a non-cryptographic committal scheme and a novel method of simulation in modes. In fact, although the protocol only requires 5 rounds and is surprisingly simple, the simulation argument is complex. Moreover, our result is essentially optimal due to the general 4-round lower bound of Goldreich and Krawczyk [3]. In this extended abstract we confine ourselves to a proof that graph isomorphism has a 5 round perfect zero knowledge interactive proof. 2 D e f i n i t i o n s 2 .1 P r o b a b i l i t y S p a c e s a n d A l g o r i t h m s These notations and conventions for probabilistic algorithms are derived from [6] and further extended. We emphasize the number of inputs received by an algorithm as follows. If algorithm A receives only one input we write \"A(.)\"; if it receives two we write \"A(., .)\", and so on. If A is a probabilistic algorithm then, for any input i the notation A(i) refers to the probability space which to the string (r assigns the probability that A, on input i, outputs or. If S is a probability space we denote by Ps (e ) the probability that S associates with element e. We denote by IS] the set of elements to which S assigns positive probability. If f ( . ) and g( . , . . . ) are probabilistic algorithms then f ( g ( . , . . . ) ) is the probabilistic algorithm obtained by composing f and g (i.e. running f on g's output) . For any inputs x , y , . . , the associated probability space is denoted f (g (x , y , . . . ) ) . If 5: is a probability space then x *-S denotes the algorithm which assigns to x an element randomly selected according to S (that is, x is assigned the value e with probability P s ( e ) ) (in the case that [,9] consists of 3nly one element e we write x ~ e rather than x +--{e}). For probability spaces S, T . . . . , the notation P ( p ( x , y , . . . ) : x ~--S ; y ~--T ; . . . ) denotes the probability that the predicate p(x, y , . . . ) is true after the (ordered) execution of the algorithms x ~-S, y ~ T, etc. The notation f f ( x , y , . . . ) : x ~-S ; y *--7 \" ; . . . } t denotes the probability space which to the string ~r assigns the probability P(cr = f ( x , y , . . . ) : x *-S ; y *-T ; . . . ) , f being some function. If S is a finite set we will identify it with the probability space which assigns to each element of S the uniform probability U(S) = ]-~. (Then x ~-S denotes the operation of selecting an element of 5' uniformly at random, and Ps (e ) = U(S) for any e E S). We let P P T denote the set of probabilistic (expected) polynomial time algorithms. 2 . 2 I n t e r a c t i v e T M s a n d P r o t o c o l s Full descriptions of interactive Turing Machines and protocols appear in [5]; we will only summarize the notation we use. The probability that (A, B) accepts the common input x is denoted P ( ( A , B ) accepts x ) , and the probability space of all conversations between A and B on input x is denoted (A ~ B) (x ) (the probability in both cases is taken over the random tapes of both A and B). Sometimes we want to make the coin tosses of B explicit. For any R E {0, 1}* we write B ( R ) for the (deterministic) machine B with R as its random tape. Then (A ~-~ B (R) ) ( x ) denotes the probability space of conversations between A and B(R) on input x (the probability is over the random tapes of A). We let B(R;x ,oq131 . . . a i l f l i -1 ) denote the next message that B ( R ) sends when the conversation up to this point was cq/31 . . . oli_l~i_ 1. Finally, it is convenient to define the state of the ITM B at any point in its computation as consisting of the contents of its tapes, the positions of the heads on these tapes, and the internal state of the machine. 2 . 3 I n t e r a c t i v e P r o o f S y s t e m s a n d Z e r o K n o w l e d g e Def in i t i on 2.1 An interactive protocol (P, V) is an interactive proof system for the language L if the following conditions hold: \u2022 Completeness: For every x E L, P ( ( P , V) accepts x) > 1 2 -I~l .",

For example, the nodes of a blockchain\nnetwork have to disseminate the blocks they create across the whole network.\nThe scientific literature typically takes the ideal perspective that such data\ndistribution is performed by broadcasting to all nodes directly, while in\npractice data is distributed by repeated multicast. Since correctness and\nsecurity of consistency maintenance protocols usually have been established for\nthe ideal setting only, it is vital to show that these properties carry over to\nreal-world implementations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove that the ideal\nand the real behavior are equivalent.\n  In the work described in this paper, we take an important step towards such a\nproof by proving a simpler variant of this equivalence statement. The\nsimplification is that we consider only a concrete pair of network topologies,\nwhich nevertheless illustrates important phenomena encountered with arbitrary\ntopologies. For describing systems that distribute data, we use a\ndomain-specific language of processes that corresponds to a class of Petri nets\nand is embedded in a general-purpose process calculus. This way, we can outline\nour proof using an intuitive graphical notation and leverage the rich theory of\nprocess calculi in the actual proof, which is machine-checked using the\nIsabelle proof assistant.",
