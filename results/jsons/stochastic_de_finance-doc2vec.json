This might also include an exact mathematical definition of a 'dissipative structure' derived from maximum entropy considerations.

Despite the wide occurrences of non-Gaussian\nfluctuations, the effective data-driven methods to identify stochastic\ndifferential equations with non-Gaussian L\\'evy noise are relatively few so\nfar. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to extract stochastic\ngoverning laws with both (Gaussian) Brownian motion and (non-Gaussian) L\\'evy\nmotion, from short bursts of simulation data. Specifically, we use the\nnormalizing flows technology to estimate the transition probability density\nfunction (solution of nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation) from data, and then\nsubstitute it into the recently proposed nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas to\napproximate L\\'evy jump measure, drift coefficient and diffusion coefficient.\nWe demonstrate that this approach can learn the stochastic differential\nequation with L\\'evy motion. We present examples with one- and two-dimensional,\ndecoupled and coupled systems to illustrate our method. This approach will\nbecome an effective tool for discovering stochastic governing laws and\nunderstanding complex dynamical behaviors.",

This work deals with the numerical approximation of the class of Markovian BSDEs where the terminal condition is a functional of a Brownian motion. Using Hermite martingales, we show that the problem of solving a BSDE is identical to solving a countable infinite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The family of ODEs belongs to the class of stiff ODEs, where the associated functional is one-sided Lipschitz. On this basis, we derive a numerical scheme and provide numerical applications.",

Whether a policy is carried out. however. should also reflect the state of the economy. so that even a \"tough\" policymaker may renege on an announced policy in adverse circumstances. We investigate this alternative notion of credibility, using an \"escape clause\" model of devaluation. in which a policymaker maintains a fixed parity in good times, but devalues if the unemployment rate gets too high. Our main conclusion is that if there is persistence in the process driving unemployment, following a tough policy in a given period may lower rather than raise the credibility of a no-devaluation pledge in subsequent periods. in contrast to the results in the earlier literature. We test this implication on EMS interest rates and find support for our hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "In this study an alternative approach for assessing securities' risk is applied. Various authors have argued that security returns are not homoskedastic but exhibit variation over time. They have observed that large changes tend be followed by more large changes in either direction, and so volatility must be predictably high after large changes. This phenomenon of securities' volatility, referred to as clustering, has important implications for security pricing and risk management. Among the most popular techniques currently used to capture the clustering effect and to forecast future volatilityare those belonging to the family of Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) models. The main aim of this paper is to investigate whether such volatility modelling can be used to capture the time variation not only in the total risk of a security return but also its systematic and unsystematic components. Using weekly local stock market data, the time varying beta with the World Index has been estimated via a bivariate GARCH-M model. The GARCH-M parameterization used here is a dynamic specification of the SIM. The hypothesis that this dynamic specification holds cannot be rejected for 11 out of 13 local portfolios. The results provide evidence that both the systematic and the non-systematic counterparts are also changing over time. However, in some markets those risk changes may take place with some delay. This suggests that some of the low correlation coefficients computed for certain stock market returns may not be due to differences in business cycles among those countries, but may be caused by the non-synchronous response to world market developments. This finding should have important implications in many investment decisions such as portfolio selection, market timing and risk hedging.",

These schemes are based on the Neumann (stochastic Taylor) and Magnus expansions. Firstly, we consider the case when the governing linear diffusion vector fields commute with each other, but not with the linear drift vector field. We prove that numerical methods based on the Magnus expansion are more accurate in the mean-square sense than corresponding stochastic Taylor integration schemes. Secondly, we derive the maximal rate of convergence for arbitrary multi-dimensional stochastic integrals approximated by their conditional expectations. Consequently, for general nonlinear stochastic differential equations with non-commuting vector fields, we deduce explicit formulae for the relation between error and computational costs for methods of arbitrary order. Thirdly, we consider the consequences in two numerical studies, one of which is an application arising in stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control.",

Different stochastic volatility models have been proposed in the past to account for both these correlations. However, in these models, the decay of the correlations is exponential, with a single time scale for both the volatility and the leverage correlations, at variance with observations. This paper extends the linear Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck stochastic volatility model by assuming that the mean reverting level is itself random. It is found that the resulting three\u2010dimensional diffusion process can account for different correlation time scales. It is shown that the results are in good agreement with a century of the Dow Jones index daily returns (1900\u20132000), with the exception of crash days.",

In this work we first obtain the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to (not necessarily) Ito SDE's in a Hubert space under Lipschitz-type conditions on the coefficients. We assume usual continuity and linear growth conditions. For nonLipschitz coefficients an approximation technique of Gikhman and Skorokhod is then used to prove the existence of weak solutions taking values in a larger Hubert space H-\\. This result depends on an assumption that H can be compactly embedded in H-\\, such that the coefficients satisfy regularity conditions with respect to H-\\. This assumption is not a limitation to our method as it is necessary even in the deterministic case. Additionally, we prove the existence of martingale solutions to infinite dimensional semilinear SDE's. In both cases, coefficients F(\u00a3, \u00b7) and J9(\u00a3, \u00b7) may depend on the entire past of X \u00a3 C([0, T], H) and not on the value of x(t) alone.",

A risk neutral valuation relationship depends only upon potentially observable parameters and it is extremely significant that such a relationship can be derived from only weak assumptions about investor preferences, for, as Merton [10] has observed: \"An exact formula for an asset price, based on observable variables only, is a rare finding in a general equilibrium model ...\".RNVRs have been derived from two quite different general classes of model: the first class places no restrictions on investor preferences beyond the assumption of non-satiety, but assumes that asset trading takes place continuously, while the second class of model places stronger restrictions on investor preferences but makes the more general assumption that asset trading takes place at discrete intervals.2 From the assumption of non-satiety alone, the only results which can be obtained are those which depend upon the absence of riskless arbitrage opportunities. In the case in which trading takes place continuously, both the underlying asset and the contingent claim are traded assets and at least one of them is infinitely divisible, and the price dynamics of the underlying asset can be de",

These paths are weighted with a probability given by the overdamped Langevin dynamics. We show how these paths can be exactly generated by a local stochastic differential equation. The method is illustrated on the generation of Brownian bridges, Brownian meanders, Brownian excursions and constrained Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes. In addition, we show how to solve this equation in the case of a general force acting on the particle. As an example, we show how to generate a constrained path joining the two minima of a double-well. Our method allows us to generate statistically independent paths and is computationally very efficient.",

The stock price is driven by a Markov Renewal Process (MRP),\nwhile market orders arrive in the limit order book via a point process\ncorrelated with the stock price itself. In this framework, we can reproduce the\nadverse selection risk, appearing in two different forms: the usual one due to\nbig market orders impacting the stock price and penalizing the agent, and the\nweak one due to small market orders and reducing the probability of a\nprofitable execution. We solve the market making problem by stochastic control\ntechniques in this semi-Markov model. In the no risk-aversion case, we provide\nexplicit formula for the optimal controls and characterize the value function\nas a simple linear PDE. In the general case, we derive the optimal controls and\nthe value function in terms of the previous result, and illustrate how the risk\naversion influences the trader strategy and her expected gain. Finally, by\nusing a perturbation method, approximate optimal controls for small risk\naversions are explicitly computed in terms of two simple PDE's, reducing\ndrastically the computational cost and enlightening the financial\ninterpretation of the results.Comment: 30 pages, new asymptotic results, typos corrected, new\n  bibliographical reference",

We explain previous empirical findings using a model based on the interacting agent hypothesis instead of the widely-used efficient market hypothesis. We derive macroscopic equations based on the microscopic herding interactions of agents and find that they are able to reproduce various stylized facts of different markets and different assets with the same set of model parameters. We show that the power-law properties and the scaling of return intervals and other financial variables have a similar origin and could be a result of a general class of non-linear stochastic differential equations derived from a master equation of an agent system that is coupled by herding interactions. Specifically, we find that this approach enables us to recover the volatility return interval statistics as well as volatility probability and spectral densities for the NYSE and FOREX markets, for different assets, and for different time-scales. We find also that the historical S\\&P500 monthly series exhibits the same volatility return interval properties recovered by our proposed model. Our statistical results suggest that human herding is so strong that it persists even when other evolving fluctuations perturbate the financial system.",

To this end, we prove (by Malliavin calculus) a representation result for the martingale component of the solution of the F-BDSDE under the assumption that the coefficients are continuous in time and continuously differentiable in space with bounded partial derivatives. As an (important) application of our L2-regularity result, we derive the rate of convergence in time for the (Euler time discretization based) numerical scheme for F-BDSDEs proposed by Bachouch et al.(2016) under only globally Lipschitz continuous assumptions",

Such\na conclusion interprets differently from the classical ordinary differential\nequation model and thus a paradox on strong Allee effect occurs.

The paper aims to develop new methodologies, which are significantly different from those of mixed dynamic optimal control and stopping problems in the existing literature. We formulate our model to a free boundary problem of a fully nonlinear equation. Furthermore, by means of a dual transformation for the above problem, we convert the above problem to a new free boundary problem of a linear equation. Finally, we apply the theoretical results to some challenging, yet practically relevant and important, risk-sensitive problems in wealth management to obtain the properties of the optimal strategy and the right time to achieve a certain level over a finite time investment horizon.

This paper studies reserve accumulation as the outcome of a simple model in which the central bank smooths inflation. I explore the view that central banks accumulate reserves to face large fiscal shocks that need monetary financing. Central bank revenues are obtained through inflation, but inflation is distortionary. As a result, the central bank optimally accumulates international reserves in order to spread the costs associated with inflation over time. A simple numerical exercise for an average developing economy using data between 1970 and 2009 yields fast growth of international reserves",

The corresponding fractional linear partial differential equation is solved by using a suitable extension of the Lagrange's technique involving an auxiliary set of fractional differential equations.

        "abstract": "The topics treated in this thesis are inherently two-fold. The first part considers the problem of a market maker who wants to optimally set bid/ask quotes over a finite time horizon, to maximize her expected utility. The intensities of the orders she receives depend not only on the spreads she quotes, but also on unobservable factors modelled by a hidden Markov chain. This stochastic control problem under partial information is solved by means of stochastic filtering, control and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes theory. The value function is characterized as the unique continuous viscosity solution of its dynamic programming equation. Afterwards, the analogous full information problem is solved and results are compared numerically through a concrete example. The optimal full information spreads are shown to be biased when the exact market regime is unknown, as the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty in terms of P&L sensitivity and observable order ow volatility. \n \nThe second part deals with numerically solving nonzero-sum stochastic differential games with impulse controls. These offer a realistic and far-reaching modelling framework for applications within finance, energy markets and other areas, but the diffculty in solving such problems has hindered their proliferation. Semi-analytical approaches make strong assumptions pertaining very particular cases. To the author's best knowledge, there are no numerical methods available in the literature. A policy-iteration-type solver is proposed to solve an underlying system of quasi-variational inequalities, and it is validated numerically with reassuring results. In particular, it is observed that the algorithm does not enjoy global convergence and a heuristic methodology is proposed to construct initial guesses. \n \nEventually, the focus is put on games with a symmetric structure and a substantially improved version of the former algorithm is put forward. A rigorous convergence analysis is undertaken with natural assumptions on the players strategies, which admit graph-theoretic interpretations in the context of weakly chained diagonally dominant matrices. A provably convergent single-player impulse control solver, often outperforming classical policy iteration, is also provided. The main algorithm is used to compute with high precision equilibrium payoffs and Nash equilibria of otherwise too challenging problems, and even some for which results go beyond the scope of all the currently available theory.",

Traditional uncertain differential equation can only deal with a continuous dynamic uncertain system. To model the sharp drifts embedded in an uncertain dynamic system, this paper proposes a type of uncertain differential equation driven by a canonical Liu process and an uncertain renewal process, which is called an uncertain differential equation with jumps. A sufficient condition for the proposed equation having a unique solution is first given, then a concept of stability for the proposed equation is provided in the sense of uncertain measure, and its sufficient condition is also derived.",

        "abstract": "We provide a new dynamic approach to scenario generation for the purposes of risk management in the banking industry. We connect ideas from conventional techniques -- like historical and Monte Carlo simulation -- and we come up with a hybrid method that shares the advantages of standard procedures but eliminates several of their drawbacks. Instead of considering the static problem of constructing one or ten day ahead distributions for vectors of risk factors, we embed the problem into a dynamic framework, where any time horizon can be consistently simulated. Additionally, we use standard models from mathematical finance for each risk factor, whence bridging the worlds of trading and risk management. Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), like the HJM-equation or the Black-Scholes equation, governing the time evolution of risk factors, on an empirical calibration method to the market for the chosen SDEs, and on an Euler scheme (or high-order schemes) for the numerical evaluation of the respective SDEs. The empirical calibration procedure presented in this paper can be seen as the SDE-counterpart of the so called Filtered Historical Simulation method; the behavior of volatility stems in our case out of the assumptions on the underlying SDEs. Furthermore, we are able to easily incorporate \"middle-size\" and \"large-size\" events within our framework always making a precise distinction between the information obtained from the market and the one coming from the necessary a-priori intuition of the risk manager. Results of one concrete implementation are provided.",

Transition probabilities are computed analytically as expansions in orthogonal polynomials to ensure that results dont depend on the size of time steps and to maintain local no-arbitrage conditions. Finally, stochastic volatility can be accounted for by means of a new class of affine lattice models.

Nevertheless, the literature about theoretical models on futures appears technically rather less developed and mathematically elaborated than other areas of mathematical finance, like equities, credit risk, or interest rate theory. This talk is concerned with general futures prices in framework of semimartingale pricing kernel models with positive interest, i.e. supermartingale pricing models. We show how recent results on supermartingale term structure models in connection with stochastic backward integration allow for a general and unifying view on discretely and continuously resettled contingent claims, and also reveal the natural martingale structure behind the appropriate numeraires for obtaining the futures price process. The analysis does not need to assume a Brownian filtration or continuous martingales. And for key results, one does not need to assume the existence of a classical savings account either. Speaker: Antje Berndt (Cornell University) Title: Measuring default risk premia from default swap rates and EDFs Abstract: This paper estimates recent default risk premia for U.S. corporate debt, based on a close relationship between default probabilities, as estimated by the Moody\u2019s KMV EDF measure, and market default swap (CDS) rates. The default-swap data, obtained by CIBC from a large number of dealers and bank counterparties, allow us to establish a strong link between actual and risk-neutral default probabilities for",

        "abstract": "This paper is an attempt at empirically investigating one of the building blocks of the foreign exchange market - the demand for foreign financial assets - under two alternative monetary policy rules (the fixed rate of growth of money rule and the feedback monetary policy rule) using time series data for Germany over the period 1974:1 - 1992:4. The approach adopted here offers us the opportunity of investigating the impact of monetary policy shocks on the demand for foreign assets. It turns out that the data-set picks the feedback monetary policy rule as characterising the data generation process better. Based on this feedback policy rule roughly 23% of monetary policy shocks have permanent effects (and the remaining percentage of these shocks exhibit transitory effects) on the demand for foreign assets. Our empirical results indicate, among others, that unanticipated monetary policy shocks and increases in the interest rate differential drive German investors abroad whereas domestic interest rate increases and currency depreciations demonstrate the \"safe-haven\" effect (that is to say domestic investors prefer having their investments in assets denominated in Deutsche Marks).",

Specific examples are the Heston and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models with square root coefficients and the Ait-Sahalia model with rational coefficient f unctions. Simple examples show that, for example, the Euler-Maruyama scheme may not converge either in the strong or weak sense when the standard assumptions do not hold. Nevertheless, new convergence results have been obtained recently for many such models in financial mathematics. These are reviewed here. Although weak convergence is of traditional importance in financial mathematics with its emphasis on expectations of functionals of the solutions, strong convergence plays a crucial role in Multi Level Monte Carlo methods, so it and also pathwise convergence will be considered along with methods which preserve the positivity of the solutions.",

Firstly, we propose an alternative approximation scheme based on\nPicard iterations. This approach is similar in accuracy to the Euler\ndiscretization, but with the feature that each rate is evolved independently of\nthe other rates in the term structure. This enables simultaneous calculation of\nderivative prices of different maturities using parallel computing. Secondly,\nthe product terms occurring in the drift of a LIBOR market model driven by a\njump process grow exponentially as a function of the number of rates, quickly\nrendering the model intractable. We reduce this growth from exponential to\nquadratic using truncated expansions of the product terms.

An important class of computational problems include so-called integro-differential equations which include both integrals and derivatives of a function. In another example, stochastic differential equations can be written in terms of a partial differential equation of a probability density function of the stochastic variable. To learn characteristics of the stochastic variable based on the density function, specific integral transforms, namely moments, of the density function need to be calculated. Recently, the machine learning paradigm of Physics-Informed Neural Networks emerged with increasing popularity as a method to solve differential equations by leveraging automatic differentiation. In this work, we propose to augment the paradigm of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with automatic integration in order to compute complex integral transforms on trained solutions, and to solve integro-differential equations where integrals are computed on-the-fly during training. Furthermore, we showcase the techniques in various application settings, numerically simulating quantum computer-based neural networks as well as classical neural networks.",

To answer this question, we consider futures price models for commodity derivatives that allow for stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rates and a correlation structure between the underlying variables. We examine the empirical pricing performance of these models on pricing long-dated crude oil derivatives. Estimating the model parameters from historical crude oil futures prices and option prices, we find that stochastic interest rate models improve pricing performance on long-dated crude oil derivatives, when the interest rate volatility is relatively high. Furthermore, increasing the model dimensionality does not tend to improve the pricing performance on long-dated crude oil option prices, but it matters for long-dated futures prices. We also find empirical evidence for a negative correlation between crude oil futures prices and interest rates that contributes to improving fit to long-dated crude oil option prices",

Our formula, which is based on an integral equation, which is equivalent to the stochastic differential equation, utilizes a discrete time approximation with fixed integration time step. We show that our integration formula approaches the Euler formula if the Poissonian noise approaches the Gaussian white noise. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are examined by studying the dynamics of an overdamped particle driven by Poissonian white shot noise in a spatially periodic potential. We find that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm only weakly depends on the parameters characterizing the Poissonian white shot noise; this holds true even if the limit of Gaussian white noise is approached.",

Stochastic differential equations with additive noise have an important role in explaining some symmetry phenomena such as symmetry breaking in molecular vibrations. Finding the exact solution of such equations is difficult in many cases. Thus, a collocation method based on sixth-kind Chebyshev polynomials (SKCPs) is introduced to assess their numerical solutions. This collocation approach reduces the considered problem to a system of linear algebraic equations. The convergence and error analysis of the suggested scheme are investigated. In the end, numerical results and the order of convergence are evaluated for some numerical test problems to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the presented method.",
