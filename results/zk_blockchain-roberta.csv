"Alessandra Scafuro,Luisa Siniscalchi,Ivan Visconti",Publicly Verifiable Zero Knowledge from (Collapsing) Blockchains,2020-01-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.INTERNET_ARCHIVE,,"Publicly Verifiable Zero-Knowledge proofs are known to exist only from setup assumptions such as a trusted Common Reference String (CRS) or a Random Oracle. Unfortunately, the former requires a trusted party while the latter does not exist. Blockchains are distributed systems that already exist and provide certain security properties (under some honest majority assumption), hence, a natural recent research direction has been to use a blockchain as an alternative setup assumption. In TCC 2017 Goyal and Goyal proposed a construction of a publicly verifiable zero-knowledge (pvZK) proof system for some proof-of-stake blockchains. The zero-knowledge property of their construction however relies on some additional and not fully specified assumptions about the current and future behavior of honest blockchain players. In this paper we provide several contributions. First, we show that when using a blockchain to design a provably secure protocol, it is dangerous to rely on demanding additional requirements on behaviors of the blockchain players. We do so by showing an ""attack of the clones"" whereby a malicious verifier can use a smart contract to slyly (not through bribing) clone capabilities of honest stakeholders and use those to invalidate the zero-knowledge property of the proof system by Goyal and Goyal. Second, we propose a new publicly verifiable zero-knowledge proof system that relies on noninteractive commitments and on an assumption on the min-entropy of some blocks appearing on the blockchain. Third, motivated by the fact that blockchains are a recent innovation and their resilience in the long run is still controversial, we introduce the concept of collapsing blockchain, and we prove that the zero-knowledge property of our scheme holds even if the blockchain eventually becomes insecure and all blockchain players eventually become dishonest.",36,https://web.archive.org/web/20210710182129/https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1435.pdf

"Wagner, Matthew Edward",Secure blockchains for cyber-physical systems,2020-01-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,,"“Blockchains are a data structure used to perform state agreement in a distributed system across an entire network. One unique trait of blockchains is the lack of a centralized trusted third-party to control the system. This prevents a corrupted trusted third party from being able to control the entire blockchain. All nodes can reach agreement in an untrusted network where nodes do not need to trust one another to believe the accuracy of the information stored. Two main issues occur when trying to apply this technology to other applications: verifiability and scalability. In previous blockchain architectures, there is no way to validate off-chain data i.e. sensor reading. Some have purposed the use of a trusted third-party. Unfortunately, using a trusted third-party undoes a main advantage of blockchains and allows corruption to become a concerning possibility. Other challenges to applying blockchains to cyber-physical systems include keeping a single ledger up-to-date in real-time. The drawbacks of Bitcoin, a popular application of blockchains, have been very well documented in terms of speed.
The main purpose of this work is to address the verifiability and scalability issues of blockchains for cyber-physical systems. It proposes a solution that expands the application of blockchains to cyber-physical systems while maintaining the benefits. If the use of blockchains is to be expanded to off-chain data, they need to have the capability to securely encapsulate the physical world in a verifiable way. The following is a list of major contributions by the work: 1) propose a framework for verifying physical transactions in a blockchain, 2) propose a method to increase scalability and allow the use of blockchains in a disconnected network, 3) propose a truncation mechanism for cyber-physical transactions that allow for real-time speed. With these three contributions, this work introduces some additional ideas to blockchains and expands their applications”--Abstract, page iii",66,https://core.ac.uk/download/352884838.pdf

To provide identity within the context of mutual distrust, this paper presents a blockchain-based digital identity solution. Without depending upon a single trusted third party, the proposed solution achieves passport-level legally valid identity. This solution for making identities Self-Sovereign, builds on a generic provable claim model for which attestations of truth from third parties need to be collected. The claim model is then shown to be both blockchain structure and proof method agnostic. Four different implementations in support of these two claim model properties are shown to offer sub-second performance for claim creation and claim verification. Through the properties of Self-Sovereign Identity, legally valid status and acceptable performance, our solution is considered to be fit for adoption by the general public.",71,https://web.archive.org/web/20200505123745/https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A789e5f26-1266-4547-a8ba-684d67d519e2/datastream/OBJ/download

Blockchain is a new class of information technology which combines cryptography and distributed ledger that already exists. The model is composed of a group of computers that collaborate towards maintaining a secured database, without storing the data at any central unit. It is the technology behind all the crypto currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Etherum and now finding its way to record everything possible. This paper focuses on the basic framework of blockchain model, its development history, prerequisites and challenges of blockchain. Finally, various current real time applications of the technology are discussed.",97,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ba97aef2654bede472a6d2c08bace1f068a3714
