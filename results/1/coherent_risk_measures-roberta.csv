To overcome these problems in risk measurement a class of coherent risk measures has been proposed. We introduce the idea behind these measures and provide an overview of suggested coherent risk measures. Finally it is shown where the limitations of such measures in practical applications are and how regulatory bodies responded to their introduction in the literature. We find that most contributions on coherent risk measurement come from the actuarial sciences and propagate a widening of the discussion among researchers and practitioners in other industries.,26,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/712cc1a4d5482d47ce0cebc834778ffc5939e8ef

The values in T of positions are represented by a.s. bounded random variables on a probability space (-; F;P). A measure of risk is simply a mapping 1⁄2 : L1 ! R. A position is acceptable to the supervisor if 1⁄2 (X) · 0, unacceptable otherwise.

We introduce the notion of coherent risk measure defined on an arbitrary set of risks, showing that it can be considered a special case of coherent upper prevision. We also prove that our definition generalizes the notion of coherence for risk measures defined on a linear space of random numbers, given in literature. We also show that Value-at-Risk does not necessarily satisfy a weaker notion of coherence called ‘avoiding sure loss’ (ASL), and discuss both sufficient conditions for VaR to avoid sure loss and ways of modifying VaR into a coherent risk measure.",30,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f52179d38d53ffe2ec0060bcbd58148f0a8e786

We give necessary and sufficient conditions on φ for Mφ to be a coherent measure. We find in this way a simple interpretation of the concept of coherence and a way to map any rational investor’s subjective risk aversion onto a coherent measure and vice–versa. We also provide for these measures their discrete versions M (N) φ acting on finite sets of N independent realizations of a r.v. which are not only shown to be coherent measures for any fixed N , but also consistent estimators of Mφ for large N .

We introduce the notion of coherent risk measure defined on an arbitrary set of risks, showing that it can be considered a special case of coherent upper prevision. We also prove that our definition generalizes the notion of coherence for risk measures defined on a linear space of random numbers, given in literature. Consistency properties of Value-at-Risk (VaR), currently one of the most used risk measures, are investigated too, showing that it does not necessarily satisfy a weaker notion of consistency called 'avoiding sure loss'. We introduce sufficient conditions for VaR to avoid sure loss and to be coherent. Finally we discuss ways of modifying incoherent risk measures into coherent ones.",55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7753ff3f092dbc1e85ed0b9ac1b3e52d21613f29

For example, recent studies have strongly criticised VaR-based models for not providing a coherent risk measure. Because of such acceptance, it is important to improve the efficiency of the touchstone for evaluating risk measures in order to achieve a fairer assessment. This is just the challenge that this paper seeks to address. This goal is achieved on the one hand by doing some simplifications in axioms of coherency without losing their major financial points, and on the other hand by removing the paradox between two of the axioms. The new concept is called 'sensible coherency', and the risk measure that satisfies the four new simplified and corrected axioms will be 'sensibly coherent'. Finally, the new axioms are applied to a particular type of lower partial moments as a case study.

However, optimal solutions to the CVaR minimization are highly susceptible to estimation error of the risk measure because the estimate depends only on a small portion of sampled scenarios. The same is equally true of the other coherent measures. In this paper, by employing robust optimization modelling for minimizing coherent risk measures, we present a simple and practical way for making the solution robust over a certain range of estimation errors. More specifically, we show that a worst-case coherent risk minimization leads to a penalized minimization of the empirical risk estimate. The worst-case risk measure developed in this paper is different from the distributionally worst-case CVaR in Zhu and Fukushima's work of 2009, but these two worst-case risk measures can be simultaneously minimized. Additionally, inspired by Konno, Waki and Yuuki's work of 2002, we examine the use of factor models in coherent risk minimization. We see that, in general, factor model-based coherent risk minimization along the lines of that pursued by Goldfarb and Iyengar in 2003 becomes computationally intractable. Therefore, we apply a simplified version to the factor model-based CVaR minimization, and see that it improves on the performance, achieving better CVaR, turnover, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio than the empirical CVaR minimization and market benchmarks.",88,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1af5e088001dd297663af90783a0485569ffac6b

employs the following objects as the building blocks: - coherent risk measures

like the price of oil, S&P500 index, or the credit spread; - risk contributions
and factor risk contributions, which provide a coherent alternative to the
sensitivity coefficients.
  We also propose two particular classes of coherent risk measures called Alpha
V@R and Beta V@R, for which all the objects described above admit an extremely
simple empirical estimation procedure. This procedure uses no model assumptions
on the structure of the price evolution.
  Moreover, we consider the problem of the risk management on a firm's level.
It is shown that if the risk limits are imposed on the risk contributions of
the desks to the overall risk of the firm (rather than on their outstanding
risks) and the desks are allowed to trade these limits within a firm, then the

(1998) the axiomatic characterization of a static coherent risk measure was extended by Jouini et al. (2004) in a multi-dimensional setting to the concept of vector-valued risk measures. In this paper, we propose a dynamic version of the vector-valued risk measures in a continuous-time framework. Particular attention is devoted to the choice of a convenient risk space. We provide dual characterization results, we study different notions of time consistency and we give examples of vector-valued risk measure processes.",98,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72c25218c8aca357cbea6127891551d974280831
