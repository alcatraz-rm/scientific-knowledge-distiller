For this purpose we introduce the notion of extreme-aggregation risk measures. The extreme-aggregation measure characterizes the most superadditive behavior of a risk measure, by yielding the worst-possible diversification ratio across dependence structures. One of the main contributions is demonstrating that, for a wide range of risk measures, the extreme-aggregation measure corresponds to the smallest dominating coherent risk measure. In our main result, it is shown that the extremeaggregation measure induced by a distortion risk measure is a coherent distortion risk measure. In the case of convex risk measures, a general robust representation of coherent extreme-aggregation measures is provided. In particular, the extreme-aggregation measure induced by a convex shortfall risk measure is a coherent expectile. These results show that, in the presence of dependence uncertainty, quantification of a coherent risk measure is often necessary, an observation that lends further support to the use of coherent risk measures in portfolio risk management",10,https://core.ac.uk/download/76981325.pdf

Grazyna Trzpiot,Some properties of risk measures,None,SupportedSources.CORE,,"The widely used risk measures as standard deviations and value at risk do not always reflect risk preferences accurately. To overcome this problem we show coherent risk approach. For making the overview of the problem of risk measure we propose a coherent risk measure approach. We started from the definition of risk (market and other) and we took a close look at construction of risk measures. We present a set of axioms according to this approach and a collection of coherent risk measures. In particular, we describe quantile risk measures, distortion risk measures with detailed presentation of the most frequent distortion functions in use. The next propositions are risk measures based on lower partial moments. We show some properties of these measures and also discuss limitations of such measures in practical applications.risk, VaR, CVaR, coherent risk measures, distortion risk measure",16,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6531075.pdf

Besides some existing coherent risk measures, several new types of coherent risk measures can be generated. We investigate the generalized shortfall risk measure’s desirable properties such as consistency with second-order stochastic dominance. By combining the performance evaluation with the risk control, we study in particular the performance ratio-based coherent risk (PRCR) measures, which is a sub-class of generalized shortfall risk measures. The PRCR measures are tractable and have a suitable financial interpretation. Based on the PRCR measure, we establish a portfolio selection model with transaction costs. Empirical results show that the optimal portfolio obtained under the PRCR measure performs much better than the corresponding optimal portfolio obtained under the higher moment coherent risk measure.",17,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e468bb0b44a338b0e624bbae8b08ced8dfba1964

It is pointed that this measure is just the negative expectation of the risk portfolio position under the probability measure through Esscher transformation. This iso-entropic risk measure is not a 0-1 risk measure and very smooth in contrast with another important coherent risk measure AV @R (Average Value at Risk). And it is a little larger than AV @R at the same level, namely it is has more prudence.

Market risk is caused by the uncertainty attached to asset values. There exit various measures trying to model market risk. The most widely accepted one is Valueat-Risk. However Value-at-Risk does not encourage portfolio diversification in general, whereas a consistent risk measure has to do so. In this work, risk measures satisfying these consistency conditions are examined within theoretical basis. Different types of coherent and convex risk measures are investigated. Moreover the extension of coherent risk measures to multiperiod settings is discussed.",52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27e8d18c2bfbb52b509e301e747b63560789d09c

To overcome these problems in risk measurement a class of coherent risk measures has been proposed. We introduce the idea behind these measures and provide an overview of suggested coherent risk measures. Finally it is shown where the limitations of such measures in practical applications are and how regulatory bodies responded to their introduction in the literature. We find that most contributions on coherent risk measurement come from the actuarial sciences and propagate a widening of the discussion among researchers and practitioners in other industries.,57,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/712cc1a4d5482d47ce0cebc834778ffc5939e8ef

Some differences among coherent and convex risk measures and Choquet expectations are accounted for in the framework of g-expectations. We show that in the family of convex risk measures, only coherent risk measures satisfy Jensen's inequality. In mathematical finance, risk measures and Choquet expectations are typically used in the pricing of contingent claims over families of measures. The different risk measures will typically yield different pricing. In this paper, we show that the coherent pricing is always less than the corresponding Choquet pricing.

We also discuss the relation between static risk measure and dynamic risk measure in the framework of g-expectations.

We argue that a good external risk measure should be robust with respect to model misspecification and small changes in the data. A new class of data-based risk measures called natural risk statistics is proposed to incorporate robustness. Natural risk statistics are characterized by a new set of axioms. They include the Basel II and III risk measures and a subclass of robust risk measures as special cases; therefore, they provide a theoretical framework for understanding and, if necessary, extending the Basel Accords. comonotonic random variables studied in the actuarial literature such as Wang et al. [49], we shall define a new class of risk measures that satisfy a new set of axioms. The new class of risk measures includes VaR with scenario analysis, and particularly the Basel II and Basel III risk measures, as special cases. Thus, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding and extending the Basel Accords when needed. Indeed, the framework includes as special cases some proposals to address the procyclicality problem in Basel II such as the countercyclical indexing risk measure suggested by Gordy and Howells [20] . The objective of a risk measure is an important issue that has not been well addressed in the existing literature. In terms of objectives, risk measures can be classified into two categories: internal risk measures used for internal risk management at individual institutions and external risk measures used for external regulation and imposed for all the relevant institutions. The differences between internal and external risk measures mirror the differences between internal standards (such as morality) and external standards (such as law and regulation). Internal risk measures are applied in the interest of an institution's shareholders or managers, whereas external risk measures are used by regulatory agencies to maintain safety and soundness of the financial system. A risk measure may be suitable for internal management but not for external regulation, or vice versa. In this paper, we shall focus on external risk measures from the viewpoint of regulatory agencies. In particular, we emphasize that an external risk measure should be robust (see §5). The main results of the paper are as follows: (i) We postulate a new set of axioms and define a new class of risk measures called natural risk statistics; furthermore, we give two complete characterizations of natural risk statistics ( §3.2). (ii) We show that natural risk statistics include the Basel II and Basel III risk measures as special cases and thus provide an axiomatic framework for understanding and, if necessary, extending them ( §4). (iii) We completely characterize data-based coherent risk measures and show that no coherent risk measure is robust with respect to small changes in the data ( § §3.3 and 5.6). (iv) We completely characterize data-based insurance risk measures and show that no insurance risk measure is robust with respect to model misspecification ( § §3.4 and 5.6). (v) We argue that an external risk measure should be robust, motivated by philosophy of law and issues in external regulations ( §5). (vi) We show that median shortfall, a special case of natural risk statistics, is more robust than expected shortfall suggested by coherent risk measures ( §5.4). (vii) We show that natural risk statistics include a subclass of robust risk measures that are suitable for external regulation ( §5.5). (viii) We provide other critiques of the subadditivity axiom of coherent risk measures from the viewpoints of diversification and bankruptcy protection ( §6). (ix) We derive the Euler capital allocation rule under a subclass of natural risk statistics including the Basel II and III risk measures ( §7). Review of existing risk measures. 2.1. Coherent and convex risk measures. Artzner et al. [5] propose the coherent risk measures that satisfy the following three axioms: Axiom A1. Translation invariance and positive homogeneity: Axiom A1 states that the risk of a financial position is proportional to its size, and a sure loss of amount b simply increases the risk by b. Axiom A1 is proposed from the accounting viewpoint. For external risk measures such as those used for setting margin deposits and capital requirements, the accounting-based axiom seems to be reasonable. Axiom A2 is a minimum requirement for a reasonable risk measure. What is questionable lies in Axiom A3, which basically means that ""a merger does not create extra risk"" (see Artzner et al. [5, p. 209]). We will discuss the controversies related to this axiom in §6. Artzner et al. [5] and Delbaen [11] also present an equivalent approach for defining coherent risk measures via acceptance sets. Föllmer and Schied [14] and Frittelli and Gianin [15] propose the convex risk measures that relax Axioms A1 and A3 to a single convexity axiom: ∀ ∈ 0 1 . A risk measure is coherent if and only if there exists a family of probability measures such that X = sup Q∈ E Q X ∀X ∈ , where E Q X is the expectation of X under the probability measure Q (see Huber [25], Artzner et al. [5], Delbane [11] ). Each Q ∈ can be viewed as a prior probability, so measuring risk by a coherent risk measure amounts to computing the maximal expectation under a set of prior probabilities. Coherent and convex risk measures are closely connected to the good deal bounds of asset prices in incomplete markets (see, e.g., Jaschke and Küchler [30], Staum [45]).",77,https://web.archive.org/web/20170923005617/http://repository.ust.hk/ir/bitstream/1783.1-7956/1/moor.1120.0577.full.pdf

F. Delbaen,Draft: Coherent Risk Measures,None,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"Part of the course was devoted to an analysis of Value at Risk and its relation to quantiles. A detailed discussion of this can be found in two papers by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber and Heath, ADEH1 and ADEH2. It will not be repeated here. We will rather concentrate on the mathematics behind the concept of coherent risk measures. They were introduced in the two mentioned papers and the mathematical theory was further developped in Delbaen (1999), D2. Further use of coherent risk measures can be found in the papers (and their references) by Jaschke, Ja and JaK, Tasche, AT and Föllmer-Schied, FS. The reader should consult the cited web-sites to find several papers dealing with this subject. The paper by Föllmer and Schied introduces a generalisation of coherent risk measures.",85,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b27edc1900df998fd76bcbe40e816907bb97d41

We say that a pair of risk measures is asymptotically equivalent if the ratio of the worst‐case values of the two risk measures is almost one for the sum of a large number of risks with unknown dependence structure. The study of asymptotic equivalence is particularly important for a pair of a noncoherent risk measure and a coherent risk measure, as the worst‐case value of a noncoherent risk measure under dependence uncertainty is typically difficult to obtain. The main contribution of this paper is to establish general asymptotic equivalence results for the classes of distortion risk measures and convex risk measures under different mild conditions. The results implicitly suggest that it is only reasonable to implement a coherent risk measure for the aggregation of a large number of risks with uncertainty in the dependence structure, a relevant situation for risk management practice.",92,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e9eea46d1da68508584acc6175b28f3fd8ad51b

The measures in this class, which arise when the controversial subadditivity property of coherent risk measures is dispensed with and positive homogeneity is weakened, include all practically used risk measures, in particular, both convex risk measures and Value-at-Risk. From a financial viewpoint, our relaxation of convexity is necessary to quantify the capital requirements for risk exposure in the presence of liquidity risk, competitive delegation, or robust aggregation mechanisms. From a decision theoretical perspective, star-shaped risk measures emerge from variational preferences when risk mitigation strategies can be adopted by a rational decision maker.",95,https://web.archive.org/web/20220503164158/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15790v3.pdf

This measure shares several desirable characteristics with the coherent risk measures, as illustrated in Artzner et al. (1997) . In Vietnam, our study makes the first attempt to utilize distortion theory, instead of utility theory, to facilitate the adoption of risk aversion level in the popular risk measures. We find that spectral risk measure is more flexible and effective to different groups of risk-adverse investors, compared to the more monotonic and conventional VaR and ES measures.",96,https://web.archive.org/web/20190430192829/http://jabes.ueh.edu.vn/Content/ArticleFiles/640bf602-7967-274a-a0fd-36c5f4052f50/JED_2017_159.pdf

In the literature we find two main schools: coherent risk measures (Artzner, Coherent Measures of Risk. Risk Management: Value at Risk and Beyond, 1998) and insurance risk measures (Wang, Insur Math Econ 21:173-183, 1997). In this note, we set to study yet another extension motivated by a third axiomatically based risk measure that has been recently introduced. In Heyde et al. (Working Paper, Columbia University, 2007), the concept of natural risk statistic is discussed as a data-based risk measure, i.e. as an axiomatic risk measure defined in the space R n . One drawback of these kind of risk measures is their dependence on the space dimension n. In order to circumvent this issue, we propose a way to define a family {ρ n } n=1,2,... of natural risk statistics whose members are defined on R n and related in an appropriate way. This construction requires the generalization of natural risk statistics to the space of infinite sequences l ∞ .",97,https://web.archive.org/web/20170812035252/http://www.ifd.dauphine.fr/fileadmin/mediatheque/IFD/MAFE_new/Assa%20morales.pdf

First, the denition of a dynamic coherent measure is introduced and some relations with its static version are given. Coherent measures are characterized by martingale-like representations, as well as by Choquet integrals of probability distortion operators. Using dieren t information updating rules (e.g. Bayes or DempsterShafer) we dene three distinct families of dynamic coherent measures.
