It allows users to act anonymously and perform transactions with high-end security. Counter measures to prevent various attacks that compromises the privacy of blockchain applications and improvising existing privacy mechanisms is the main concern in this area. Zero Knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique which has the potential to revolutionize the way data is collected, used and transacted with. It allows the user to hide the information that he possess but still able to prove its validity to others, thereby opens far-reaching prospects in the privacy preservation mechanism of blockchain applications. This paper gives an insight about the various Zero Knowledge Proof protocols like NIZKP, ZKRP, zk-SNARK, Bulletproof etc. that have evolved over time, and its role in privacy management in the era of blockchain. keywords blockchain, zero knowledge proof, privacy, cryptography _____________________________________________________________________________________________________",

It brings the characteristics like transparency, decentralization, immutability, and the distributed ledger in one package. The user identity of the public blockchain is anonymous on the network and cannot control the confidentiality and privacy of their data. The Anonymity of a user does not mean privacy. The importance of user and data privacy and confidentiality in blockchain technology is realized and is yet to be addressed by blockchain protocols. Zero-Knowledge-Proof can be the best solution to this problem. It is relatively new and is developing very rapidly. Zero-Knowledge-Proof can provide strong privacy if the security model is well understood and used carefully. Zero-Knowledge-Proof makes sure that no one accesses the secured data except the user.

In the environment of blockchain, all historical transaction data are recorded and stored. However, because blockchain is open and transparent, a malicious user may illegally access private transaction data, including transaction amount, account address, and account balance. As a cryptographic technique, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) can be used to verify whether the prover has enough transaction amount in the environment of blockchain without leaking any private transaction data. This article provides a comprehensive survey on ZKP in the environment of blockchain with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. It first discusses the framework, models and applications of ZKP. Next, it provides an introduction of blockchain, and proposes a framework of ZKP in the environment of blockchain. Then, it highlights the current state of ZKP in the environment of blockchain. Finally, it identifies some potential problems and future research directions.",

One of the main topics of interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy mechanisms, as for example is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed) Advances in cryptology- EUROCRYPT 2000, Springer, Berlin, 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al.",

        "abstract": "Data security is very important in maintaining the confidentiality of the information itself, especially if the information is only known by certain parties. Sending data or information without security will be at risk of being tapped. So that the information contained in it can be easily known by unauthorized parties, and things like that are very detrimental. Until now, cryptography is one of the solutions to ensure the security of information. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol that can be used by someone to prove someone's ownership (prover) of confidential information to others (verifier), without the need to disclose the information or provide a way for other people to find out the secret. The test result is Zero Knowledge Proof divides one data stream into small blocks. Each of these blocks is encrypted separately. In an implementation without proof of knowledge, the key to encrypt will only be with the user, and by that, he will be able to encrypt and decrypt the information. Zero knowledge proof algorithm is a unique method by which the user can prove to other users that he knows additional information.",

And it will cause the accumulation of data on the chain and resulting in the low efficiency of block verification, when the whole transaction on the chain is verified. In order to improve the efficiency and privacy protection of block data verification, this paper proposes an efficient block verification mechanism with privacy protection based on zeroknowledge proof (ZKP), which not only protects the privacy of users but also improves the speed of data block verification. There is no need to put the whole transaction on the chain when verifying block data. It just needs to generate the ZKP and root hash with the transaction information, then save them to the smart contract for verification. Moreover, the ZKP verification in smart contract is carried out to realize the privacy protection of the transaction and efficient verification of the block. When the data is validated, the buffer accepts the complete transaction, updates the transaction status in the cloud database, and packages up the chain. So, the ZKP strengthens the privacy protection ability of blockchain, and the smart contracts save the time cost of block verification.",

Therefore, in order to verify the contents of all transactions, the data itself is compressed, but the scalability is limited. In addition, since a separate verification algorithm is used for each type of transaction, the verification burden increases as the size of the transaction increases. Existing blockchain cannot participate in the network because it does not become a block sink by using a server with a low specification. Due to this problem, as the time passes, the data size of the blockchain network becomes larger and it becomes impossible to participate in the network except for users with abundant resources. Therefore, in this paper, we are improved transaction as studied the zero knowledge proof algorithm for general operation verification. In this system, the design of zero-knowledge circuit generator capable of general operation verification and optimization of verifier and prover were also conducted.",

Suppose Alice runs some computation off-chain, and in her computation, she obtains some secret witness, such as the details of a z-cash transaction, or the location of a newly-generated planet in the zk-game, Darkforest[2]. Alice would like the chain to commit the state changes her computation made, without revealing her secret witness and without the chain rerunning her entire computation on-chain. To this end, she would like a protocol where she, the prover, can convince the chain, the verifier, that a statement is true, but reveal nothing else.",

Zero knowledge protocols have practical applications in cryptography and are used in many applications. While some applications only exist on a specification level, a direction of research has produced real-world applications. Zero knowledge protocols, also referred to as zero knowledge proofs, are a type of protocol in which one party, called the prover, tries to convince the other party, called the verifier, that a given statement is true. Sometimes the statement is that the prover possesses a particular piece of information. This is a special case of zero knowledge protocol called a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge. Formally, a zero-knowledge proof is a type of interactive proof.",

However, blockchain requires massive information including details of every transaction, the information of the dealer and buyer, which makes the privacy of every user on blockchain vulnerable. With the presence of Zcash, a new concept called Zero-Knowledge proof which focuses on proving and verifying identities appears in front of every researcher and engineer working on blockchain. Because of the enormous quantity of the ZKP schemes and the limited time, in this article, we have compared four main ZKP algorithms-ZK-SNARK, ZK-STARK, MPC protocol-based algorithms, and Bulletproof. By comparing these algorithms, we intend to give relevant engineers and researchers a general understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms. In addition, we try to make the relevant people aware of the application scenarios of each ZKP.",

        "abstract": "Publicly Verifiable Zero-Knowledge proofs are known to exist only from setup assumptions such as a trusted Common Reference String (CRS) or a Random Oracle. Unfortunately, the former requires a trusted party while the latter does not exist. Blockchains are distributed systems that already exist and provide certain security properties (under some honest majority assumption), hence, a natural recent research direction has been to use a blockchain as an alternative setup assumption. In TCC 2017 Goyal and Goyal proposed a construction of a publicly verifiable zero-knowledge (pvZK) proof system for some proof-of-stake blockchains. The zero-knowledge property of their construction however relies on some additional and not fully specified assumptions about the current and future behavior of honest blockchain players. In this paper we provide several contributions. First, we show that when using a blockchain to design a provably secure protocol, it is dangerous to rely on demanding additional requirements on behaviors of the blockchain players. We do so by showing an \"attack of the clones\" whereby a malicious verifier can use a smart contract to slyly (not through bribing) clone capabilities of honest stakeholders and use those to invalidate the zero-knowledge property of the proof system by Goyal and Goyal. Second, we propose a new publicly verifiable zero-knowledge proof system that relies on noninteractive commitments and on an assumption on the min-entropy of some blocks appearing on the blockchain. Third, motivated by the fact that blockchains are a recent innovation and their resilience in the long run is still controversial, we introduce the concept of collapsing blockchain, and we prove that the zero-knowledge property of our scheme holds even if the blockchain eventually becomes insecure and all blockchain players eventually become dishonest.",

Because privacy has a probability of leaking out during the transmissions. With a new method without knowing and verifying the privacy, the verification method will have a revolution. The traditional verification pattern can be rewritten. This paper introduces the history of verification or secret protection and specifically discusses the theory of zero-knowledge proof. After pointing out that the disadvantage of zero-knowledge is time-consuming, this paper expends the theory with zk-SNARK which stands for \u201czero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge\u201d. The part of zk-SNARK gives 2 implementations by linear algebra and polynomial. This paper lists 3 applications of zk-SNARK, which are z-cash, filecoin and loopring 3.0 in detail. In the end, this paper presents the advantage of zero-knowledge proof with the comparison of other currencies and discusses the risk of using zero-knowledge proof as contracts.",

Zero knowledge proof protocol is a essential component of cryptography, which in recent years has increasingly popular amongst scholars. Its applications have widened and it has made inroads in several areas including mathematics and network safety and so on. This simple protocol based on zero knowledge proof by which user can prove to the authentication server that he has the password without having to send the password to the server either clear text or in encrypted format. This is a protocol in which the data learned by one party (i.e., The inspector) allow him/her to verify that a statement is true but does not reveal any additional information. In this paper we first discuss about zero-knowledge protocol proof system of knowledge and also key exchange between users and which then is modified into an authentication scheme with secret key exchange for confidentiality. The whole protocol involves mutual identification of two users, exchange of a random common secret key or session key for the verification of public keys.",

Among all the schemes for the privacy protection, the zero-knowledge proof algorithm conceals most of the private information in a transaction, while participants of the blockchain can validate this transaction without the private information. However, current schemes are only aimed at blockchains with the UTXO model, and only one type of assets circulates on these blockchains. Based on the zero-knowledge proof algorithm, this paper proposes a privacy protection scheme for blockchains that use the account and multi-asset model. We design the transaction structure, anonymous addresses and anonymous asset metadata, and also propose the methods of the asset transfer and double-spending detection. The zk-SNARKs algorithm is used to generate and to verify the zero-knowledge proof. And finally, we conduct the experiments to evaluate our scheme.",

Therefore, this paper proposes an atom based on zero-knowledge proof. Improved methods of exchange to ensure the privacy of both parties in a transaction. The anonymous improvement scheme in this article uses the UTXO unconsumed model to add a new anonymous list in the blockchain. When sending assets to smart contracts, zero-knowledge proof is used to provide self-certification of ownership of the asset, and then the transaction is broken down. Only the hash value of the transaction is sent to the node, and the discarded list is used to verify the validity of the transaction, which achieves the effect of storing assets anonymously in the smart contract. At the same time, a smart contract is added when the two parties in the transaction communicate to exchange the contract address of the newly set smart contract between the two parties in the transaction.

Therefore, in order to verify the contents of all transactions, the data itself is compressed, but the scalability is limited. In addition, since a separate verification algorithm is used for each type of transaction, the verification burden increases as the size of the transaction increases. Existing blockchain cannot participate in the network because it does not become a block sink by using a server with a low specification. Due to this problem, as the time passes, the data size of the blockchain network becomes larger and it becomes impossible to participate in the network except for users with abundant resources. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the zero knowledge proof algorithm for general operation verification. In this system, the design of zero-knowledge circuit generator capable of general operation verification and optimization of verifier and prover were also conducted. Also, we developed an algorithm for optimizing key generation. Based on all of these, the zero-knowledge proof algorithm was applied to and tested on the virtual machine so that it can be used universally on all blockchains.",

Once given over, the user releases all control and ownership of her/his information. Some users of the Internet rely on strong server-side protections and the assurances that the data will be used ethically in their best interests. Recent legislation actions have focused on limiting the amount of data required and regulating the usage of that data once collected. However, a new subset of cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, may eliminate the need for users to relinquish their data. These zero-knowledge proofs combined with Blockchain technology could give users complete ownership of their information and provide them with the ability to revoke a third-parties access to it. This survey report is a review the current body of literature relating to this topic with the goal of understanding the feasibility of this solution.",

So we need to use strong security method for secure data transaction. Cryptography is a security tool which helps to transmit information from one place to another place over computer network. Cryptography follows encryption and decryption methods for data transmission. Cryptographic technique is completely based on key generation because it needs keys to transmit data between users. However cryptography works well in secure data transmission but it needs keys to provide security for data. In cryptography generation of keys taking more time than transmission of data. So in this paper we discuss about Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) which is also based on cryptographic technique. ZKP is also useful in secure data transmission without sharing key values between users. This paper tells about overview of ZKP and how it is useful in data transmission.",

        "abstract": "Performing a fair exchange without a Trusted Third Party (TTP) was considered to be impossible. With multi party computation and practices like Proof-of-Work (PoW), blockchain accomplishes a fair exchange in a trustless network. Data confidentiality is a key challenge that has to be resolved before adopting blockchain for enterprise applications where tokenized assets will be transferred. Protocols like Zcash are already providing the same for financial transactions but lacks flexibility required to apply in most of the potential use cases of blockchain. Most of the real world application work in a way where a transaction is carried out when a particular action is performed. Also, the zero knowledge proof method used in Zcash, ZKSNARK has certain weaknesses restricting its adoption. One of the major drawbacks of ZKSNARK is that it requires an initial trust setup phase which is difficult to achieve in blockchain ecosystem. ZKSTARK, an interactive zero knowledge proof does not require this phase and also provides security against post quantum attacks. We propose a system that uses two indistinguishable hash functions along with ZKSTARK to improve the flexibility of blockchain platforms. The two indistinguishable hash functions are chosen from SHA3-finalists based on their security, performance and inner designs.",

This paper presents a simple algorithm based on zero knowledge proof by which the receiver can confirm the integrity of data without the sender having to send the digital signature of the message directly. Also, if the same document is sent across by the same user multiple times, this scheme results in different digital signature each time thus making it a practical one-time signature scheme.",

There is a method to certify certain attributes of various data, either this is health metrics or finance information, without revealing the data itself or any other kind of personal data. This method is known as zero-knowledge proofs. Zero-Knowledge techniques are mathematical methods used to verify things without sharing or revealing underlying data. Zero-Knowledge protocols have vast applications from simple identity schemes and blockchains to defense research programs and nuclear arms control",

        "abstract": "With the development of Internet technology, Internet technology provides a platform for charity to allow people to participate together. Currently, each charitable blood donation registration agency operates independently, donors need to fill in personal information multiple times to register and log in when they want to register with different institutions. The information is collected by various platforms, which increases the risk of personal information leakage. In order to protect the security of the personal information used by the user during registration, and relieve the user from the many troubles caused by the leakage of personal information. This article proposes a user registration and login method based on blockchain technology, through the construction of a alliance chain, the blockchain technology is integrated with the registration and login system. To ensure that the user\u2019s information is kept confidential to the charity blood donation platform and use the mobile phone number to register in the alliance chain under the premise of hiding the user\u2019s login application record, successful registration can log in to all platforms on the alliance chain. The alliance chain system issues unique identification numbers to the charitable blood donation platform nodes in the chain, and users use their accounts to post transactions to apply for login nodes, and generate zero-knowledge range proofs to hide login records during the application login process.",

Next, we go over a wide range of different strategies and techniques, along with their respective empirical implementations. Starting with approaches that attempted to provide privacy on Bitcoin/existing blockchain systems, then going into more advanced techniques, such as secure multi-party computations, ring signatures, and zero knowledge proofs, that construct a more advanced blockchain system from scratch with the objective of preserving privacy. Finally, we conclude that the current state of privacy on blockchains still needs work for it to be reliable. Nevertheless, the field of privacy in this domain is developing and advancing at a rapid rate.",

Since then, blockchain technology has many more advancements that are being developed and experimented. In particular, recent blockchain platforms such as Ethereum offer general and executable scripts, namely smart contracts, that can be employed to develop decentralized applications (DApps) in many domains beyond payment. However, the transparency of blockchain data raises concerns for many applications that require high privacy level. Therefore, many privacy enhancing technologies have been applied to DApp development, including zero knowledge proof (ZKP). This paper focuses on a particular kind of ZKP, called zero knowledge range proof (ZKRP), that has been applied in blockchain-based payments for banks. ZKRP allows a user to convince other people that a secret value actually lies within an interval without revealing any information about the secret. Here we introduce a new ZKRP which has the following remarkable features: (1) Non-interactive: No communication is required between a user and a verifier during the proof. (2) Range-flexibility: There is no limitation on the lower bound and the upper bound of the range except that they are natural numbers. (3) Efficiency: Our scheme is modified from that of Pang et al. (2010), yet achieves better security and is more efficient than their scheme. We believe our new ZKRP can be beneficial to the development of DApps and can extend the application scope to more scenarios.",

In order to communicate and exchange data with each other, IoT devices must pass by a gateway that belongs to the same network. But, considering the mobility of such devices and their constraints, it becomes difficult to trust and to connect from a gateway to another. Therefore, this paper introduces a blockchain-based secure handover protocol. It ensures an anonymous mutual authentication solution between a mobile IoT device and a visited gateway by using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocol. To do, simulations have been performed thanks to a discrete events simulator.

        "abstract": "Mobile edge computing is a recent trend to complement the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem in the computing sector. IoT is the internet connected communications related to physical devices and everyday objects. The emergence of intelligent living spaces has been due to the rapid development of IoT technologies. Blockchain is one such technology that expands the list of information also referred to like records that are saved as blocks in the Blockchain which are connected using cryptographic algorithms. Within a Blockchain IoT environment, when data or device authentication information is stored in a Blockchain, authentication information can be displayed when verifying Block chain\u2019s transactions, which are also referred to as proof of work. A principle of Zero-knowledge proof (ZKF) is implemented in this paper which is a way of proving that knowledge is known without exposing any data to the user. The proposed model uses a Mobile application where users can prove without revealing users' passwords. Blockchain stores client information that can prevent data from being manipulated. The results of applying the ZKF theory for data security are shown through a web application and NFC.",

The first being able to combine my PhD research on blockchain technology with my work at ING. Second, I was told that ING\u2019s blockchain team is one of the best teams out there. Curious about the team, I decided to go for lunch with Coen and Cees, co-authors of this paper. To get further acquainted with them, as well as to gain insight in their many blockchain related projects, I asked: \u2018What is it that you\u2019re currently working on?\u2019. The passionate answer was: \u2018We have created an efficient zero-knowledge range proof for Ethereum\u2019. Considering the knowledge, skills and experience required to successfully create and implement such a proof, my motivation for changing jobs was confirmed. Ever since, that motivation has been confirmed, many times. Back on topic: we continued talking about how the Zero Knowledge Range Proof (ZKRP) works, the benchmark results, and why it is of value. This and more, I would like to share with you as well.",

        "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proofs are protocols that allow a prover to convince a verifier that she has some secret information that satisfies some public requirement without revealing the secret itself (e.g., to prove that she is of age without revealing how old she is). Research in this area has been thriving in recent years, due to its applications in privacy-preserving technologies and in blockchain. However, the incumbent threat posed by quantum computers requires to switch gear: as many of the current protocols are not secure against large universal quantum computers, applications need to be ready to switch to newer protocols, so-called post-quantum, that are secure even in case of a quantum attack. This project aims to survey the current usage of zero-knowledge proofs in blockchains, with a particular focus on Zcash (https://z.cash/), and to assess vulnerability to quantum attacks. The final goal would be to identify requirements for post-quantum alternatives in terms of length of produced tokens and efficiency. Supervision. The student will work alongside dr. Cecilia Boschini, a Postdoc researcher in the Cryptography and Quantum Information group of Prof. Stefan Wolf. She has been doing research on post-quantum cryptography both in the academic and in the company environment (previously to USI, she was employed at IBM Research Zurich). Her knowledge of zero-knowledge proofs and of postquantum cryptography will help the student getting quickly comfortable with the topic. Requirements. This project would be a good introduction to a research topic in cryptography that has gained a lot of attention lately, due to its wide-spread applications. As such, familiarity with cryptography, security and blockchain at the time of starting the project is required. Quantum-safe Messaging: Security Assessment of the Signal Messaging App Dr. Cecilia Boschini, Prof. Stefan Wolf Abstract. Secure messaging relies on cryptography to guarantee both the integrity and the confidentiality of messages. The security of such building blocks comes from so called computational assumptions: they are secure if some mathematical problems are hard to solve. So far, this has been true: even the largest supercomputers would take decades before breaking such problems. However, the introduction of quantum computers has changed the paradigm: with universal, large enough quantum computer it will be possible to solve such problems in a short amount of time, thus breaking the security of the schemes. Quantum-safe alternatives (so-called post-quantum) are already available, and basic post-quantum cryptographic schemes are already in the process of being standardized. What is needed to use them in practice are security assessments: which part of the architecture of secure messaging apps is vulnerable, and what would it be necessary to fix it? The goal of this project is to analyze the security of a particular messaging app, Signal (https://www.signal.org/). Signal was chosen because of its security (arguably the best model among existing messaging apps), openness (the code and the architecture are open-source and peer-reviewed), and its commitment to an ethical and sustainable approach to security.

Code transformation engine for the highperformance computing library utopia. Abstract Utopia is an open source C++ library (bitbucket.org/zulianp/utopia) developed at ICS-USI in collaboration with CSCS (Swiss National Supercomputing Centre). The goal of this library is to provide hardware portable (CPU/GPU) codes for parallel algebra which can be employed for scientific simulations, optimization problems, and machine learning algorithms. Utopia is currently being used in several PASC (pasc-ch.org) projects such as FASTER, AV-Flow, and StagBL. The main goal of this project is to implement a system for performing code transformations from small python code snippets to C/C++ code. This generated code is compiled just in time, and will run on acceleration hardware such as multicore CPUs and GPUs. This will allow utopia-python users to extend functionalities without the need of diving into complex C++ code nor sacrificing performance. The project focus will be on Python to C/C++ automated translation, code transformation, and just in time compilation. During the course of this project the student will: \u2022 work independently on specific development goals; \u2022 research the state of the art in scientific software; \u2022 participate in developing open-source community codes; \u2022 interact with developers and users; \u2022 learn and use basic concepts of C++; \u2022 use the GIT version control system, CMake/Makefile build systems, and Docker containers; \u2022 implement a simple simulation tool using the developed tools.",

In addition to their direct applicability in cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs serve as a good benchmark for the study of various problems regarding cryptographic protocols (e.g., \"secure composition of protocols\" and the \"use of of the adversary's program within the proof of security\").

However, attackers may infer the identities of the parties through detailed transaction data, and impair the privacy of users. Among these data, the transaction value is one of the most important transaction data. Therefore, for the privacy protection during blockchain transactions, this paper, based on the homomorphic encryption technology, enabled the committer peer to update the ledger during the transaction without knowing the balance of the parties\u2019 accounts and the transaction value. Meanwhile, the zero-knowledge proof scheme was introduced. It was proved by interval range that the committer peer can verify the validity of the transaction without knowing the transaction value.",

The privacy protection of blockchain technology has always been the core issue of people's attention. In this paper, some existing solutions to the current problems of user identity and transaction privacy protection are surveyed, including coin mixing mechanism, zero knowledge proof, ring signature and other technologies. Secondly, five typical applications of privacy protection technology based on blockchain are proposed and analyzed, which are mainly divided into technology applications based on coin mixing protocol, encryption protocol, secure channel protocol and so on. Finally, in view of the shortages of the existing blockchain privacy protection technology, we explore future research challenges that need to be studied in order to preserve privacy in blockchain system, and looks forward to the future development direction.

        "abstract": "During last few years, along with blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies have found huge attention from both commercial and scientific perspectives. Cryptocurrencies are digital coins which use cryptographic tools to allow secure peer-to-peer monetary transactions. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency that allows direct payments between pseudonyms without any third party. If a user\u2019s pseudonym is linked to her identity, all her transactions will be traceable, which will violate her privacy. To address this, various privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies have been proposed that use different cryptographic tools to achieve anonymous transactions. Zerocash is one of the most popular ones that uses zero-knowledge proofs to hide the source, destination and value of each transaction. This thesis consists of two main parts. In the first part, after a short overview of some cryptocurrencies (precisely Bitcoin, Monero and Zerocoin), we will explain the construction of Zerocash cryptocurrency and discuss the intuition behind the construction. More precisely, we will introduce the deployed primitives and will discuss the role of each primitive in the construction of the coin. In particular, we explain zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (a.k.a. zk-SNARKs) that play the main role in achieving strong privacy in Zerocash. Due to the importance of zk-SNARKs in privacy-preserving applications, in the second part of the thesis, we will present a new variation of Groth\u2019s 2016 zk-SNARK that currently is the most efficient pairing-based scheme. The main difference between the proposed variation and the original one is that unlike the original version, new variation guarantees nonmalleability of generated proofs. Our analysis shows that the proposed changes have minimal effects on the efficiency of the original scheme and particularly it outperforms Groth and Maller\u2019s 2017 zk-SNARK that also guarantees non-malleability of proofs.",

In order to better solve the problem of privacy protection in the current blockchain, for the application of e-commerce blockchain, the Pedersen commitment mechanism is adopted to hide the transaction amount, combined with zero-knowledge proof technology to realize the verification of the transaction amount. At the same time, an efficient range proof scheme based on polynomial commitment and vector inner-product commitment is used to verify whether the transaction amount and the balance of both parties are greater than zero. Finally, use the homomorphism promised by Pedersen to update the ciphertext ledger. The security analysis and efficiency test of the proposed blockchain privacy protection algorithm show that compared with the existing schemes, the proposed algorithm has the advantages of strong security and higher efficiency.",

However, in order to use blockchain effectively, it is necessary to consider security and privacy aspects. This paper presents a survey of different security and privacy aspects of blockchain. In particular, we present the common types of security attacks on blockchain and security enhancement solutions. We also focus on the existing solutions to protect privacy for blockchain, and on the directions for future research using group signature and zero-knowledge schemes. Group signature scheme can be used to validate transactions in a blockchain network, and zero-knowledge to guarantee that transactions are valid despite the fact that the detailed information of transactions remains obscure. The combination of group signature and zero-knowledge could be feasible solutions for improving security and privacy for blockchain. This solution could also be deployed for IoT networks.",

In this, the zero-knowledge evidence is applied to a smart metering system to show how to improve the anonymity of the blockchain for privacy safety without disclosing information as a public key. Within this article, a blockchain has been implemented to deter security risks such as data counterfeiting by utilizing intelligent meters. Zero-Knowledge Proof, an anonymity blockchain technology, has been implemented through block inquiry to prevent threats to security like personal information infringement. It was suggested that intelligent contracts would be used to avoid falsification of intelligent meter data and abuse of personal details.",

We make traceability of assets in the permissioned blockchain be defined and be expressed as a hidden Markov model. There exists no dishonest increase and decrease of assets in this model. The condition is called balance. As we encrypt this model with fully homomorphic encryption and apply the zero knowledge proof of plaintext knowledge, we show that the trace-ability and balance of the permissioned blockchain are able to be proved in zero knowledge to the permissionless blockchain with concealing the asset allocation of the permissioned blockchain.",

In some industries such as finance, confidentiality is paramount to protect business-critical information from becoming public; however, in a smart contract, information needs to be known and independently verified. A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) can be used to obscure this information when there are only two parties in the contract; however, ZKPs do not have a mechanism to handle situations in which multiple parties are involved. We introduce, discuss, and simulate a consensus-based secret sharing protocol which provides zero knowledge of personal information, only allows members to participate if they have a key, and only works when a specified number of members \u201cvote.\u201d This enhances the ability for smart contracts to work in situations where majority votes are needed, but the confidentiality of members needs to be preserved.",

Wood is a byproduct of several states, ranging from standing trees to logs, lumber, and wood products (hereinafter \u201cwood objects\u201d) . The advantage of using the blockchain for record keeping is that participants can freely record the information at their discretion, without any restrictions. However, the openness of the blockchain may allow a malicious third party to introduce disinformation. In this study, we employ ZKP and near-field communication (NFC) chips to eliminate the possibility of disinformation introduction. ZKP is used to prove/validate changes in the state of wood objects, and the unique nonce associated with that state is encrypted and recorded on an NFC chip. The nonce is concealed and id of the wood object is defined as hash value of this nonce. We developed a prototype system based on an Android application and an Ethereum smart contract. We confirm that wood traceability and verification can be performed using the prototype system.",

One of the most adopted blockchain ecosystems is based around Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum currently has a huge scaling issue, making its use very expensive. Different scaling solutions are proposed based on Optimistic rollups but they have a very long finality time. Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollup (based on ZK Proof) is another way and offers high security with very fast final resolution. Problem with ZK rollup is that it is very computationally expensive, but some solutions have significant performance improvements. In this paper we presented different solutions that improve performance of ZK rollup.",

In the most widely used public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, all activities on user accounts are publicly disclosed and also violate privacy regulations such as EU GDPR. Encryption of accounts and transactions may protect privacy, but it also raises issues of validity and transparency: encrypted information alone cannot verify the validity of a transaction and makes it difficult to meet antimoney laundering, i.e. auditability. To solve the above problem, we propose an auditable zeroknowledge transfer framework called Azeroth. Azeroth connects a zero-knowledge proof for an encrypted transaction, enabling to check its validation while protecting its privacy. Azeroth also allows authorized auditors to audit transactions. Azeroth is designed as a smart contract for flexible deployment on top of an existing blockchain. According to the result of our experiment, the additional time required to generate a proof is about 901ms.The security of Azeroth is formally proven under the cryptographic assumptions.",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin brings a new type of digital currency that does not rely on a central\nsystem to maintain transactions. By benefiting from the concept of\ndecentralized ledger, users who do not know or trust each other can still\nconduct transactions in a peer-to-peer manner. Inspired by Bitcoin, other\ncryptocurrencies were invented in recent years such as Ethereum, Dash, Zcash,\nMonero, Grin, etc. Some of these focus on enhancing privacy for instance crypto\nnote or systems that apply the similar concept of encrypted notes used for\ntransactions to enhance privacy (e.g., Zcash, Monero). However, there are few\nmechanisms to support the exchange of privacy-enhanced notes or assets on the\nchain, and at the same time preserving the privacy of the exchange operations.\nExisting approaches for fair exchanges of assets with privacy mostly rely on\noff-chain/side-chain, escrow or centralized services. Thus, we propose a\nsolution that supports oblivious and privacy-protected fair exchange of crypto\nnotes or privacy enhanced crypto assets. The technology is demonstrated by\nextending zero-knowledge based crypto notes. To address \"privacy\" and\n\"multi-currency\", we build a new zero-knowledge proving system and extend note\nformat with new property to represent various types of tokenized assets or\ncryptocurrencies. By extending the payment protocol, exchange operations are\nrealized through privacy enhanced transactions (e.g., shielded transactions).\nBased on the possible scenarios during the exchange operation, we add new\nconstraints and conditions to the zero-knowledge proving system used for\nvalidating transactions publicly.",

It is shown that after a preprocessing stage consisting of O(k) executions of oblivious transfer, any polynomial number of NP-theorems of any polysize can be proved noninteractively and in zero knowledge, on the basis of the existence of any one-way function, so that the probability of accepting a false theorem is less than 1/2/sup k/.<<ETX>>",

        "abstract": "The last decade has seen tremendous growth in both the adoption and understanding of public ledger technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As these cryptocurrencies have risen in popularity, other ideas have also seen a rise in prominence due to a perceived relevance to the blockchain. One example of this is Zero Knowledge Proofs. While they were first conceived of in 1989 by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff[1], they have gained more attention recently. However, there seems to be a lack of consensus as to where they are best used. We designed an example application whose backbone runs entirely on the blockchain with the support of zero-knowledge proofs. In doing so, we investigated the usefulness, ease of adoption, and practicality of these proofs. For our sample application, we settled on the classic game of Battleship. We implemented our game in an entirely decentralized manner, using zero-knowledge proofs to validate the moves made by each player, and the blockchain as the only \u201cbackend\u201d of the system. We successfully achieved our goal of implementing a proof-of-concept that delivers upon these goals, providing evidence to the usefulness of zkps. Along with our implementation, we developed a strong understanding of the state of zeroknowledge proofs in the modern world, analyzing both their strengths and weaknesses. Our proofof-concept demonstrates that zero-knowledge applications are viable and practical for certain uses, but also exposed particular problems in using the blockchain for real-time applications. However, we feel that this could be addressed with relatively minor modifications, and does very little to diminish the usefulness of the actual zero-knowledge proofs.",
