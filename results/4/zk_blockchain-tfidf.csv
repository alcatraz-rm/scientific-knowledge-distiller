We make traceability of assets in the permissioned blockchain be defined and be expressed as a hidden Markov model. There exists no dishonest increase and decrease of assets in this model. The condition is called balance. As we encrypt this model with fully homomorphic encryption and apply the zero knowledge proof of plaintext knowledge, we show that the trace-ability and balance of the permissioned blockchain are able to be proved in zero knowledge to the permissionless blockchain with concealing the asset allocation of the permissioned blockchain.",7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a94f839b960382f3c4dc7da4c50d17a5cb2d0fa

"Labazova, Olga",Blockchain Application in Information Systems Research,2020-12-22 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,,"Blockchain is a radical innovation with a core value proposition of shifting trust from institutions towards algorithms. Still, the potential of Blockchains remains vague due to the knowledge gap between computer science and socio-economic activities. Ninety percent of current Blockchain projects did not move from ideas to production-ready prototypes. Researchers and practitioners are searching for the meaningful leveraging of Blockchains for value creation. 

This dissertation aims to bridge the gap between technical and managerial knowledge of Blockchain that allows successful Blockchain system design and implementation. Therefore, the objective of the project is to identify the scope of Blockchain applications and introduce guidelines to make purposeful decisions of Blockchain implementations. 

The dissertation project covers four research questions. First, I consolidated knowledge of Blockchain technical configurations through the development of a taxonomy. Second, I considered the design patterns of smart contracts that represent the application logic of Blockchain systems. Third, I offered guidance for transforming initial conceptions of Blockchain ideas into working system prototypes by introducing a Blockchain configuration process model. Fourth, I investigated the common factors of Blockchain decisions to evaluate Blockchain implementations in the form of the framework.

I employed a Design Science Research approach to developing four artefacts. The first three artefacts consider technical, application, and organizational aspects of Blockchain. The synergy reflects in the fourth, combinational artefact, which employs the high-level factors of Blockchain decisions. During the project, I have investigated the scientific and business studies, run Blockchain-based applications, conduct interviews, and evaluate the findings on Blockchain projects.

The dissertation project contributes to research by bridging knowledge gaps between computer science and socio-economic research on a Blockchain that provides a fruitful ground for future conceptual and empirical studies. For practitioners, the developed artefacts are useful to identify and guide Blockchain projects that facilitate purposeful Blockchain adoption",75,https://core.ac.uk/download/395100247.pdf

There is a sidechain that connects the permissionless blockchain and the permissioned blockchain. The behavior in the permissioned blockchain is almost a black box from the perspective of the permissionless blockchain. While this fact is useful for privacy protection, there is room for improvement in terms of transparency. To improve the transparency of the permissioned blockchain under privacy protection, we consider traceability in the permissioned blockchain consisting of the following three properties: trade privacy (who trades with whom and at what asset amount), preservation (the total amount inside the permissioned blockchain, including deposits and withdrawals to the permissionless blockchain, is immutable), and noninvolvement (some members in the permissioned blockchain are not involved in some trades, and it is possible to prove that specified members performed the transaction). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve both preservation and noninvolvement while protecting the privacy of transactions. Our approach is as follows. We model traceability based on the hidden Markov model. Because the proof of traceability requires the calculation of more than quadratic degrees, we encrypt this model by homomorphic encryption. The number of participants in the permissioned blockchain corresponds to the number of additions in the model. Then, we can construct the encrypted model by employing somewhat homomorphic encryption. The establishment of the original model is verifiable by applying the noninteractive zero-knowledge proof of the knowledge that the plaintext is equal to zero. This is an adaptation of Benhamouda et al. (Asiacrypt 2014).",77,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b23000ee5c698b608d5f4e189e987d5034d57e8a

"Sewpersadh, Natisha",Knowledge-mapping of blockchain technology applications for a banking institution,2019-01-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,,"Abstract : Blockchain technology is a relatively new technology which provides many opportunities for knowledge-mapping. Blockchain technology is best described as a decentralised ledger system that stores information about transactions and uses digital currencies such as Bitcoin. The best possible utilisation of a new technology usually depends on how quickly people can develop and apply new knowledge of the technology. Knowledge is a key component to leverage the most useful features of any new technology. Moreover, it is crucial to know how to avoid the pitfalls of a new technology in order to develop solutions. This study’s unit of analysis is knowledge of blockchain technology, that is, the knowledge possessed by people operating in the banking industry. The banking industry is sternly regulated in all jurisdictions and employee know-how is a valuable resource. The recent wide dissemination of blockchain technology, the popularity of cryptocurrencies, and the Initial Coin Offering have contributed to the fact that financial institutions’ management underline the vast potential of blockchain technology in the financial industry. For example, large banks are conducting tests of decentralised asset technology and implementing decentralised ledger systems in business processes. Banks are investing in projects and start-ups that are developing blockchain-based solutions. Therefore, bank employees with know-how and prior experience with blockchain are essential to create blockchain solutions. The objective of this study is to map the existing know-how and identify knowledge gaps of blockchain technology know-how and its possible application in a South African Banking Institution (SABI). This is done through an analysis of knowledge of how the utilisation of blockchain technology changes the existing operations models of financial institutions. The research methodology consists of an inductive knowledge-mapping strategy and mixed-method approach. The quantitative data collection method involved gathering data via an online questionnaire sent to a purposive sample, namely, SABI’s clients, investors, experts, and individuals with the common denominator: Blockchain technology knowledge interest who had attended the Blockchain Africa Conference. The qualitative data collection method was an interview with individuals who had a specific technical knowledge of blockchain technology, with the common denominator: SABI blockchain knowledge group. iv The data analysis was sequential; the quantitative data analysis was followed by qualitative data analysis. The findings identify categories of knowledge that are needed to inform and build new blockchain technology-based operations models. Knowledge gaps were identified in the SABI. Based on the findings, the study conceptualises a knowledge map and develops a theory, namely: If the blockchain knowledge maps of financial institutions integrate knowledge across their Core Banking Application pillars, then the financial services industry will create an Internet of Value-Exchange advantage for everyone on the network. Further study is required in order to test this theory. A key recommendation is to perform knowledge-mapping of the Core Banking Application pillars as the next step of SABI’s knowledge maturity of blockchain technology. In conclusion, knowledge maturity of blockchain technology is essential to create an Internet of Value-Exchange advantage for everyone within the network. The mapping of knowledge provides a measurement of knowledge maturity. Blockchain technology provides many opportunities for knowledge-mapping.M.Phil.

It allows users to act anonymously and perform transactions with high-end security. Counter measures to prevent various attacks that compromises the privacy of blockchain applications and improvising existing privacy mechanisms is the main concern in this area. Zero Knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique which has the potential to revolutionize the way data is collected, used and transacted with. It allows the user to hide the information that he possess but still able to prove its validity to others, thereby opens far-reaching prospects in the privacy preservation mechanism of blockchain applications. This paper gives an insight about the various Zero Knowledge Proof protocols like NIZKP, ZKRP, zk-SNARK, Bulletproof etc. that have evolved over time, and its role in privacy management in the era of blockchain. keywords blockchain, zero knowledge proof, privacy, cryptography _____________________________________________________________________________________________________",83,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48b4db447aec8b8821ddbbb09d394bbf32d2e385
