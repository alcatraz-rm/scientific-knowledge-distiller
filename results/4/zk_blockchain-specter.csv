It brings the characteristics like transparency, decentralization, immutability, and the distributed ledger in one package. The user identity of the public blockchain is anonymous on the network and cannot control the confidentiality and privacy of their data. The Anonymity of a user does not mean privacy. The importance of user and data privacy and confidentiality in blockchain technology is realized and is yet to be addressed by blockchain protocols. Zero-Knowledge-Proof can be the best solution to this problem. It is relatively new and is developing very rapidly. Zero-Knowledge-Proof can provide strong privacy if the security model is well understood and used carefully. Zero-Knowledge-Proof makes sure that no one accesses the secured data except the user.

"Aayush Gupta,N. Kaashoek,Brice Wang,Jason Zhao",Zero-Knowledge Battleship,None,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"The last decade has seen tremendous growth in both the adoption and understanding of public ledger technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As these cryptocurrencies have risen in popularity, other ideas have also seen a rise in prominence due to a perceived relevance to the blockchain. One example of this is Zero Knowledge Proofs. While they were first conceived of in 1989 by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff[1], they have gained more attention recently. However, there seems to be a lack of consensus as to where they are best used. We designed an example application whose backbone runs entirely on the blockchain with the support of zero-knowledge proofs. In doing so, we investigated the usefulness, ease of adoption, and practicality of these proofs. For our sample application, we settled on the classic game of Battleship. We implemented our game in an entirely decentralized manner, using zero-knowledge proofs to validate the moves made by each player, and the blockchain as the only “backend” of the system. We successfully achieved our goal of implementing a proof-of-concept that delivers upon these goals, providing evidence to the usefulness of zkps. Along with our implementation, we developed a strong understanding of the state of zeroknowledge proofs in the modern world, analyzing both their strengths and weaknesses. Our proofof-concept demonstrates that zero-knowledge applications are viable and practical for certain uses, but also exposed particular problems in using the blockchain for real-time applications. However, we feel that this could be addressed with relatively minor modifications, and does very little to diminish the usefulness of the actual zero-knowledge proofs.",11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a80c00830a5b67af37111680f3e15938b6851674

Unfortunately, the former requires a trusted party while the latter does not exist. Blockchains are distributed systems that already exist and provide certain security properties (under some honest majority assumption), hence, a natural recent research direction has been to use a blockchain as an alternative setup assumption. In TCC 2017 Goyal and Goyal proposed a construction of a publicly verifiable zero-knowledge (pvZK) proof system for some proof-of-stake blockchains. The zero-knowledge property of their construction however relies on some additional and not fully specified assumptions about the current and future behavior of honest blockchain players. In this paper we provide several contributions. First, we show that when using a blockchain to design a provably secure protocol, it is dangerous to rely on demanding additional requirements on behaviors of the blockchain players. We do so by showing an ""attack of the clones"" whereby a malicious verifier can use a smart contract to slyly (not through bribing) clone capabilities of honest stakeholders and use those to invalidate the zero-knowledge property of the proof system by Goyal and Goyal. Second, we propose a new publicly verifiable zero-knowledge proof system that relies on noninteractive commitments and on an assumption on the min-entropy of some blocks appearing on the blockchain. Third, motivated by the fact that blockchains are a recent innovation and their resilience in the long run is still controversial, we introduce the concept of collapsing blockchain, and we prove that the zero-knowledge property of our scheme holds even if the blockchain eventually becomes insecure and all blockchain players eventually become dishonest.",17,https://web.archive.org/web/20210710182129/https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1435.pdf

In the environment of blockchain, all historical transaction data are recorded and stored.

As a cryptographic technique, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) can be used to verify whether the prover has enough transaction amount in the environment of blockchain without leaking any private transaction data. This article provides a comprehensive survey on ZKP in the environment of blockchain with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. It first discusses the framework, models and applications of ZKP. Next, it provides an introduction of blockchain, and proposes a framework of ZKP in the environment of blockchain.

It allows users to act anonymously and perform transactions with high-end security. Counter measures to prevent various attacks that compromises the privacy of blockchain applications and improvising existing privacy mechanisms is the main concern in this area. Zero Knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique which has the potential to revolutionize the way data is collected, used and transacted with. It allows the user to hide the information that he possess but still able to prove its validity to others, thereby opens far-reaching prospects in the privacy preservation mechanism of blockchain applications.

We analyze the function or, in more strong words, the ""ultimate purpose"" of blockchain in the blockchain-partial systems, and present a conceptual model we named proof-chain that quite satisfactorily represented the general paradigm of blockchain in blockchain-partial systems. A universal tension between strength of proof-chain and privacy is then revealed and the zero-knowledge based proof-chain takes shape. Several case studies demonstrate the explaining power of our proof-chain methodology. We then apply proof-chain methodology to the analysis of the ecosystem of a collaborating group of blockchain-partial systems, representing the paradigm of public and private data domain whose border the proof-chain crosses.

Incentives are designed to encourage any party to contribute their knowledge by buying tokens of mathematical propositions that they believe are true.

An implementation of this blockchain proposal, once established, will provide the general public with an easy and instant access to reliable knowledge without having to read difficult proofs or having to blindly trust a small number of experts. Conversely, experts from various fields may find it much easier for making their work appreciated by more people, leading to a better impact. According to the incentive inherently provided by the blockchain, they can even earn significantly if they do prove some theorems that were not previously known by the blockchain. Foundations who are interested in the validity of a particular proposition not yet explicitly recorded on the blockchain can donate a fund, which will distribute to experts who contribute positive efforts toward solving the specified problems.

era. In common situations, however, revealing secrets appears unavoidable, for
instance, when identifying oneself in a bank to retrieve money. In turn, this
may have highly undesirable consequences in the unlikely, yet not unrealistic,
case where the bank's security gets compromised. This naturally raises the
question of whether disclosing secrets is fundamentally necessary for
identifying oneself, or more generally for proving a statement to be correct.
Developments in computer science provide an elegant solution via the concept of
zero-knowledge proofs: a prover can convince a verifier of the validity of a
certain statement without facilitating the elaboration of a proof at all. In
this work, we report the experimental realisation of such a zero-knowledge
protocol involving two separated verifier-prover pairs. Security is enforced
via the physical principle of special relativity, and no computational
assumption (such as the existence of one-way functions) is required. Our
implementation exclusively relies on off-the-shelf equipment and works at both
short (60 m) and long distances ($\geqslant$400 m) in about one second. This
demonstrates the practical potential of multi-prover zero-knowledge protocols,
promising for identification tasks and blockchain applications such as
cryptocurrencies or smart contracts.",90,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10452v2

such as secure multi-party computations, ring signatures, and zero knowledge
proofs, that construct a more advanced blockchain system from scratch with the
objective of preserving privacy. Finally, we conclude that the current state of
privacy on blockchains still needs work for it to be reliable. Nevertheless,
the field of privacy in this domain is developing and advancing at a rapid
rate.",96,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10642v1

However, blockchain requires massive information including details of every transaction, the information of the dealer and buyer, which makes the privacy of every user on blockchain vulnerable. With the presence of Zcash, a new concept called Zero-Knowledge proof which focuses on proving and verifying identities appears in front of every researcher and engineer working on blockchain. Because of the enormous quantity of the ZKP schemes and the limited time, in this article, we have compared four main ZKP algorithms-ZK-SNARK, ZK-STARK, MPC protocol-based algorithms, and Bulletproof. By comparing these algorithms, we intend to give relevant engineers and researchers a general understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms. In addition, we try to make the relevant people aware of the application scenarios of each ZKP.",97,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea9b02fa8c17e75d1e5820148b56b207c2803fb1
