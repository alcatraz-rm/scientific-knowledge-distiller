a fee of approx. 349.20 USD per exchange. We address this issue by defining
cost fairness, which can be used to assess two-party exchange protocols

Its applications are far beyond the financial sector. The transaction verification process for cryptocurrencies is much slower than traditional digital transaction systems. One approach to scalability or the speed at which transactions are processed is to design a solution that offers faster Proof of Work. In this paper, we propose a method for accelerating the process of Proof of Work based on parallel mining rather than solo mining. The goal is to ensure that no more than two or more miners put the same effort into solving a specific block. The proposed method includes a process for selection of a manager, distribution of work and a reward system. This method has been implemented in a test environment that contains all the characteristics needed to perform Proof of Work for Bitcoin and has been tested, using a variety of case scenarios, by varying the difficulty level and number of validators. Experimental evaluations were performed locally and in a cloud environment, and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility the proposed method.",2,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1af2ce2c74f80545cc908772ea520a52a3af0a81

"Pithadia, Hirsh Jaykrishnan",Algorithmic Regulation using AI and Blockchain Technology,2021-11-28 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,,"This thesis investigates the application of AI and blockchain technology to the domain of Algorithmic Regulation. Algorithmic Regulation refers to the use of intelligent systems for the enabling and enforcement of regulation (often referred to as RegTech in financial services). The research work focuses on three problems: a) Machine interpretability of regulation; b) Regulatory reporting of data; and c) Federated analytics with data compliance. Uniquely, this research was designed, implemented, tested and deployed in collaboration with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Santander, RegulAItion and part funded by the InnovateUK RegNet project. I am a co-founder of RegulAItion. 

/ Using AI to Automate the Regulatory Handbook: In this investigation we propose the use of reasoning systems for encoding financial regulation as machine readable and executable rules. We argue that our rules-based “white-box” approach is needed, as opposed to a “black-box” machine learning approach, as regulators need explainability and outline the theoretical foundation needed to encode regulation from the FCA Handbook into machine readable semantics. We then present the design and implementation of a production-grade regulatory reasoning system built on top of the Java Expert System Shell (JESS) and use it to encode a subset of regulation (consumer credit regulation) from the FCA Handbook. We then perform an empirical evaluation, with the regulator, of the system based on its performance and accuracy in handling 600 “real- world” queries and compare it with its human equivalent. The findings suggest that the proposed approach of using reasoning systems not only provides quicker responses, but also more accurate results to answers from queries that are explainable. 

/ SmartReg: Using Blockchain for Regulatory Reporting: In this investigation we explore the use of distributed ledgers for real-time reporting of data for compliance between firms and regulators. Regulators and firms recognise the growing burden and complexity of regulatory reporting resulting from the lack of data standardisation, increasing complexity of regulation and the lack of machine executable rules. The investigation presents a) the design and implementation of a permissioned Quorum-Ethereum based regulatory reporting network that makes use of an off-chain reporting service to execute machine readable rules on banks’ data through smart contracts b) a means for cross border regulators to share reporting data with each other that can be used to given them a true global view of systemic risk c) a means to carry out regulatory reporting using a novel pull-based approach where the regulator is able to directly “pull” relevant data out of the banks’ environments in an ad-hoc basis- enabling regulators to become more active when addressing risk. We validate the approach and implementation of our system through a pilot use case with a bank and regulator. The outputs of this investigation have informed the Digital Regulatory Reporting initiative- an FCA and UK Government led project to improve regulatory reporting in the financial services. 



/ RegNet: Using Federated Learning and Blockchain for Privacy Preserving Data Access In this investigation we explore the use of Federated Machine Learning and Trusted data access for analytics. With the development of stricter Data Regulation (e.g. GDPR) it is increasingly difficult to share data for collective analytics in a compliant manner. We argue that for data compliance, data does not need to be shared but rather, trusted data access is needed. The investigation presents a) the design and implementation of RegNet- an infrastructure for trusted data access in a secure and privacy preserving manner for a singular algorithmic purpose, where the algorithms (such as Federated Learning) are orchestrated to run within the infrastructure of data owners b) A taxonomy for Federated Learning c) The tokenization and orchestration of Federated Learning through smart contracts for auditable governance. We validate our approach and the infrastructure (RegNet) through a real world use case, involving a number of banks, that makes use of Federated Learning with Epsilon-Differential Privacy for improving the performance of an Anti-Money-Laundering classification model",3,https://core.ac.uk/download/483550586.pdf
"Stefan Dziembowski,Grzegorz Fabianski,Sebastian Faust,Siavash Riahi",Lower Bounds for Off-Chain Protocols: Exploring the Limits of Plasma,2020-01-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.INTERNET_ARCHIVE,,"Blockchain is a disruptive new technology introduced around a decade ago. It can be viewed as a method for recording timestamped transactions in a public database. Most of blockchain protocols do not scale well, i.e., they cannot process quickly large amounts of transactions. A natural idea to deal with this problem is to use the blockchain only as a timestamping service, i.e., to hash several transactions tx 1, . . . , tx m into one short string, and just put this string on the blockchain, while at the same time posting the hashed transactions tx 1, . . . , tx m to some public place on the Internet (""off-chain""). In this way the transactions tx i remain timestamped, but the amount of data put on the blockchain is greatly reduced. This idea was introduced in 2017 under the name Plasma by Poon and Buterin. Shortly after this proposal, several variants of Plasma have been proposed. They are typically built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, as they strongly rely on so-called smart contracts (in order to resolve disputes between the users if some of them start cheating). Plasmas are an example of so-called off-chain protocols. In this work we initiate the study of the inherent limitations of Plasma protocols. More concretely, we show that in every Plasma system the adversary can either (a) force the honest parties to communicate a lot with the blockchain, even though they did not intend to (this is traditionally called mass exit); or (b) an honest party that wants to leave the system needs to quickly communicate large amounts of data to the blockchain. What makes these attacks particularly hard to handle in real life is that these attacks do not have so-called uniquely attributable faults, i.e. the smart contract cannot determine which party is malicious, and hence cannot force it to pay the fees for the blockchain interaction. An important implication of our result is that the benefits of two of the most prominent Plasma types, called Plasma Cash and Fungible Plasma, cannot be achieved simultaneously. Besides of the direct implications on real-life cryptocurrency research, we believe that this work may open up a new line of theoretical research, as, up to our knowledge, this is the first work that provides an impossibility result in the area of off-chain protocols.",4,https://web.archive.org/web/20210219032552/https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/175.pdf

"Rehman, Ali Akbar",System for Workflow Design and Execution on Data Shared Between Untrusting Organizations for Analytics,2022-01-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,,"Performance of complex analytics \& AI algorithms typically involves large amounts of data. The data may originate from multiple sources and is typically compiled and moved to a central location before it can be consumed by the algorithms, making this approach impractical for untrusting organizations interested to share analytics and results but not risking the exposure of the dataset in its entirety. Current approaches to support such a scenario for data consumption is to move the computation closer to the data instead of the other way around. But that involves writing code for distributed file systems like Hadoop File System (HDFS), which demands professional expertise in writing Map-Reduce jobs and parallel code design patterns. In this thesis, we demonstrate a proof of concept allowing organizations to share their datasets for consumption by inter-organizational workflows without exposing the data itself and avoiding distributed programming expertise. We propose an approach using Hyperledger Fabric for untrusting entities to advertise their datasets for consumption by other organizations without demanding extensive knowledge of writing distributed code, and all this without ever exposing the data itself to the user. Hence the analytics can be run on the data while maintaining ownership. A permissioned blockchain network is established using Hyperledger Fabric and organizations can join the mentioned consortium. A JupyterHub server is hosted on a Kubernetes cluster that services users with a Jupyter instance where users can explore the datasets available through our custom extension, write code and construct workflows running the algorithms on the datasets. The required datasets are consumed as persistent volumes when running the workflow; only exposing the data to the job requiring it. To ensure the privacy of sensitive information committed to the blockchain, organizations encrypt the sensitive information with keys that are internal to the organization",8,https://core.ac.uk/download/542947712.pdf

in web3 today, specifically within identity solutions, and argue that the
current standard DID v1.0 is sufficiently under specified, allowing for many
methods and instantiations, including blockchain based certificates. We view
experiments today in web3 identity as additive and complementary, and argue
that often cited differences are of degree and more in form, less in substance.
By way of illustration, we compare decentralized naming services and blockchain
based identity certificates such as soulbound tokens (SBTs) to decentralized
identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs). Both paradigms, to the
extent they can be meaningfully differentiated, share similar potential as well
as challenges. Specifically, we refer to fears about non consensual
verification (scarlet letters) and show DID method iterations are not immune by
issuing an innocuous public scarlet letter to a DIDs associated public address
for anyone to see. Moreover, we argue that because SBTs are unspecified, one
could characterize SBTs as an iteration, or extension, of VCs that additionally
aspire to achieve composability with web3 smart contracts for correct execution
of code, privacy, coercion resistance, and censorship resistance. We offer
research paths for how VCs can also achieve these properties. We do not comment

"Kanth, Vikram K.",FRAMEWORK FOR ANONYMIZED COVERT COMMUNICATIONS: A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED PROOF-OF-CONCEPT,2022-09-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,,"In this dissertation, we present an information hiding approach incorporating anonymity that builds on existing classical steganographic models. Current security definitions are not sufficient to analyze the proposed information hiding approach as steganography offers data privacy by hiding the existence of data, a property that is distinct from confidentiality (data existence is known but access is restricted) and authenticity (data existence is known but manipulation is restricted). Combinations of the latter two properties are common in analyses, such as Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), yet there is a lack of research on combinations with steganography. This dissertation also introduces the security definition of Authenticated Stegotext with Associated Data (ASAD), which captures steganographic properties even when there is contextual information provided alongside the hidden data. We develop a hierarchical framework of ASAD variants, corresponding to different channel demands. We present a real-world steganographic embedding scheme, Authenticated SteGotex with Associated tRansaction Data (ASGARD), that leverages a blockchain-based application as a medium for sending hidden data. We analyze ASGARD in our framework  and show that it meets Level-4 ASAD security. Finally,  we implement ASGARD on the Ethereum platform as a proof-of-concept and analyze some of the ways an adversary might detect our embedding activity by analyzing historical Ethereum data.Lieutenant, United States NavyApproved for public release.

learned by a large-scale pre-trained model and adapts it to downstream tasks

largely boost the performance of visual prompt learning. Moreover, our
experiments show that SeMap is capable of achieving competitive zero-shot
transfer, indicating that it can perform the downstream task without any
fine-tuning on the corresponding dataset. This demonstrates the potential of
our proposed method to be used in a broader range of applications where the
zero-shot transfer is desired. Results suggest that our proposed SeMap could

  The internals of cryptocurrency mining is very opaque and difficult to study
since it traditionally requires forming relationships with miners, who are
typically reticent to share internal information about their competitive
advantages. This work takes a different approach by combining large-scale
statistical techniques with publicly available blockchain data in order to
answer previously intractable questions. The crux of our analysis technique is
based on the simple observation that some miners can utilize their hashpower
more efficiently due to their position in the network. By teasing out that
effect, we de-bias the mining power distribution to get a more accurate
estimate. Using that de-biased mining power distribution, we can answer
questions about the network position of miners in each cryptocurrency network.

We propose Verilay, the first chain relay scheme that enables validating PoS protocols that produce finalized blocks, for example, Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, and Polkadot. The concept does not require changes to the source blockchain protocols or validator operations. Signatures of block proposers are validated by a dedicated relay smart contract on the target blockchain. In contrast to basic PoW chain relays, Verilay requires only a subset of block headers to be submitted in order to maintain full verifiability. This yields enhanced scalability. We provide a prototypical implementation that facilitates the validation of Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain headers within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Our evaluation proves the applicability to Ethereum 1.0’s mainnet and confirms that only a fraction of transaction costs are required compared to PoW chain relay updates.",23,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32d401e85e5c97e8013e5f130b30587e7ae84d98

The main novelty is that the proof-of-work for mining a block is divided into multiple stages. An appropriate linkage structure is defined so that it becomes possible to simultaneously work on various stages of different blocks. The overall effect is an improvement in the transaction processing rate and the time for confirming a transaction. These are achieved without compromising on security. The division of the proof-of-work into several stages also divides the block reward into an equal number of stage rewards. Once a block gets onto the blockchain, the miner which successfully completed a particular stage can claim the reward for that stage. This ensures a more equitable distribution of the reward for successfully mining a block.",26,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e2d643fd8b90d05ec392ce6502cdb795ea0e25c

new blockchains to fork or partially reuse the code of classic blockchains. For
example, the popular Dogecoin, Litecoin, Binance BSC, and Polygon are all
variants of Bitcoin/Ethereum. These ""forked"" blockchains thus could encounter
similar vulnerabilities that are propagated from Bitcoin/Ethereum during
forking or subsequently commit fetching. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
study of detecting and investigating the propagated vulnerabilities in forked

tool that can effectively and efficiently detect multiple types of cloned

Specifically, BlockScope adopts similarity-based code match and designs a new
way of calculating code similarity to cover all the syntax-wide variant (i.e.,
Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3) clones. Moreover, BlockScope automatically extracts
and leverages the contexts of patch code to narrow down the search scope and
locate only potentially relevant code for comparison. Our evaluation shows that
BlockScope achieves good precision and high recall both at 91.8% (1.8 times
higher recall than that in ReDeBug). BlockScope allows us to discover 101
previously unknown vulnerabilities in 13 out of the 16 forked projects of

Binance, and 4 from Optimism. We have reported all the vulnerabilities to their

Whether States find the Treaty verifiable depends on the available capabilities, but also on political assumptions and requirements. Verification plays an important role in the transformation towards a NWFW to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in a hostile environment where uncertainties are seen as threatening.

Of the multiple vulnerabilities that exist in Web application software, proper authentication of the client and the server to each other is fundamental to the security of the system. In the current scenario, we manage this with the adoption of password-based client authentication and PKI-based server authentication. There exist unresolved vulnerabilities in this system due to the misuse of the client's passwords (impersonation) by those managing the servers. The clients' trust of the server based on the certificates issued by an increasing number of certification authorities is questionable in terms of validity and freshness. For proper authentication in Web applications, we need to verify two conditions: 1) the binding of the identity of the entity with the publicly known name or key and 2) the entity does possess the corresponding private key for the identified public key.

However, with the Internet’s characteristic of pervasiveness, information breaches from both external hacking and internal corruption are continuously encroaching a company’s economic profit. This dissertation consists of three studies where each study investigates the different aspects of information security, and it is aimed to address the growing concern of securing a company’s information assets. The first study examines the external hackers’ behaviors and models a Bayesian game between a firm and two discrete types of hackers (domestic and international) based on the framework of Inspection Game. This study explains why external hackings, especially the international ones, are hard to prevent effectively. The second study is an empirical work and explores the other side of information security data breach, which is mainly due to insiders’ (e.g., employee) malicious deeds or noncompliance with information security policy. This study shows that individual reward and punishment together with 100% detection is the best incentive structure to reduce insider data breaches. In addition, the second study finds that individual reward is more effective than individual punishment, which can better explain why employees are more willing to spend time to comply with security policy when a reward is present. Lastly, the third study is a conceptual work and relies on the Theory of Bounded Rationality to discuss how the Blockchain technology can undermine the motivations of both external and internal intruders in order to prevent information breaches. Overall, this dissertation discusses the current issues of hacking, constructs a payment/incentive structure to regulate noncompliance, empirically tests the validity of the proposed structure, points out a solution to advance information security defense, and provides some managerial recommendations to practitioners",45,https://core.ac.uk/download/141670992.pdf

Blockchain-based process execution approaches are no exception to this, but are severely limited by the inherent properties of the platform: The isolated environment prevents direct access to external entities and data, and the non-continual runtime based entirely on atomic transactions impedes the monitoring and detection of events. In this paper we provide an in-depth examination of the semantics of deferred choice, and transfer them to environments such as the blockchain. We introduce and compare several oracle architectures able to satisfy certain requirements, and show that they can be implemented using state-of-the-art blockchain technology.",49,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b5679fa8844110604b1da6f309f8f3e1729eaf6

"K. Chalkias,Kevin Lewi,Payman Mohassel,V. Nikolaenko",Distributed Auditing Proofs of Liabilities,None,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"The Distributed Auditing Proofs of Liabilities (DAPOL) are schemes designed to let companies that accept (i) monetary deposits from consumers (i.e., custodial wallets, blockchain exchanges, banks, gambling industry etc.) or (ii) fungible obligations and report claims from users (i.e., daily reporting of COVID-19 cases , negative product reviews, unemployment rate, disapproval voting etc.) to prove their total amount of liabilities or obligations without compromising the privacy of both users’ identity and individual amounts. Throughout this document we’ll often refer to one of DAPOL’s most popular use cases, which is proving solvency of cryptocurrency exchanges. Solvency is defined as the ability of a company to meet its long-term financial commitments. In finance and particularly in blockchain systems, proof of solvency consists of two components: 1. Proof of liabilities: proving the total quantity of coins the exchange owes to all of its customers. 2. Proof of reserves (also known as proof of assets): proving ownership of digital assets (i.e., coins) in the blockchain. Typically, an exchange should prove that the total balance of owned coins is greater than or equal to their liabilities, which correspond to the sum of coins their users own internally to their platform. It is highlighted that this proposal focuses on the proofs of liabilities part only, mainly because the same solution can be applied to a broad range of applications, even outside solvency, and secondly because the proof of assets part cannot easily be generalized and it differs between blockchain types due to different privacy guarantees offered per platform [14; 18; 30; 31]. The extra benefit of DAPOL compared to conventional auditor-based approaches is it provides a transparent mechanism for users to validate their balance inclusion in the reported total amount of liabilities/obligations and complements the traditional validation performed by the auditors by adding extra privacy guarantees. This document focuses on a particular class of auditing cases, in which we assume that the audited entity does not have any incentive to increase its liabilities or obligations. Although proofs of liabilities are an essential part of proving financial solvency, it will be shown that there are numerous applications of DAPOL, including their use in tax earning statements, “negative” voting and transparent reports of offensive content in social networks, among the others. The recommended approach combines previously known cryptographic techniques to provide a layered solution with predefined levels of privacy in the form of gadgets. The backbone of this proposal is based on the enhanced Maxwell’s Merkle-tree construction and is extended using balance splitting tricks, efficient padding, verifiable random functions, deterministic key derivation functions and the range proof techniques from Provisions and ZeroLedge solvency protocols, respectively. Because Bulletproofs [5], Gro16 [23], Ligero [1], Plonk [21], Halo [3] and other efficient ZKP constructions were not available or mature when the above solvency protocols were published, we will assume that any efficient zero knowledge scheme for set membership in summation structures can be a good candidate, but we hope we will agree as a community on one or two concrete constructions.",52,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/76a2fdfa95622562b067a8d7ac84eeabbef86556

Compared with the traditional, e-voting is widely used in various decision scenarios because of the convenience, easy to participate and low cost. However, the proposed e-voting protocols are at the risk of excessive authority and tampered information, which makes it impossible to achieve true fairness and transparency in e-voting. By combining the blockchain technology, it enables to solve these problems with the decentralization and tamper-resistant features. Moreover, the misoperations of the voters will also affect this fairness, such as voting for non-candidates, abstention or repeated voting. Therefore, to ensure the efficiency of the voting process and maintain the fairness of the voting environment, it is important to append the function of audit in e-voting protocol. This paper proposes an e-voting protocol based on blockchain, which provides transparency in the process of voting. At the same time, this scheme has the ability to audit voters operating incorrectly and resist quantum attacks by adopting the certificateless and code-based cryptography. After performance analysis, our scheme is suitable for the small-scale election and has some advantages in security and efficiency when the number of voters is small.

The world is migrating towards the digitization of vaccination documentation. Still, the current digital vaccination is a centralized model, lacking a universal acceptance. A Universally Acceptable and Ideal Vaccination System (UAIVS) should possess (a) a standard vaccination certificate verification algorithm, (b) privacy to personal information, (c) scalability, (d) support for all vaccinations, (e) accountability for vaccination information access, and (f) a scope for scientific research and development.

distributed applications in a simple manner. This simplicity stems from the
inherent utility of employing the state of smart contracts to store, query and
verify the validity of application data. In Ethereum, data storage incurs an
underpriced, non-recurring, predefined fee. Furthermore, as there is no
incentive for freeing or minimizing the state of smart contracts, Ethereum is
faced with a tragedy of the commons problem with regards to its monotonically
increasing state. This issue, if left unchecked, may lead to centralization and
directly impact Ethereum's security and longevity. In this work, we introduce
an alternative paradigm for developing smart contracts in which their state is
of constant size and facilitates the verification of application data that are
stored to and queried from an external, potentially unreliable, storage
network. This approach is relevant for a wide range of applications, such as
any key-value store. We evaluate our approach by adapting the most widely
deployed standard for fungible tokens, i.e., the ERC20 token standard. We show
that Ethereum's current cost model penalizes our approach, even though it
minimizes the overhead to Ethereum's state and aligns well with Ethereum's
future. We address Ethereum's monotonically increasing state in a two-fold
manner. First, we introduce recurring fees that are proportional to the state
of smart contracts and adjustable by the miners that maintain the network.
Second, we propose a scheme where the cost of storage-related operations
reflects the effort that miners have to expend to execute them. Lastly, we show
that under such a pricing scheme that encourages economy in the state consumed
by smart contracts, our ERC20 token adaptation reduces the incurred transaction
fees by up to an order of magnitude.Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures, DAPPCON 201",61,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00881

We hypothesize that just like decentralized exchanges (DEXes) that by now are by some measures more popular than traditional exchanges, process in the space of decentralized finance (DeFi) may enable attractive online trading automation options. In this paper we present ChainBot, an approach for creating algorithmic trading bots with the help of blockchain technology. We show how to partition the algorithmic computation into onand off-chain components in a way that provides a measure of end-to-end integrity, while preserving the algorithmic “secret sauce”. The end result is a system where an enduser can sign-up for the services of a trading bot, with trust established via on-chain publicly readable contracts. Our system is enabled with a careful use of algorithm partitioning and zero-knowledge proofs together with standard smart contracts available on most modern blockchains. Our approach offers more transparent access to liquidity and better censorship-resistance compared to traditional off-chain trading approaches both for cryptoand more traditional assets. We show that the end-to-end costs and execution times are affordable for regular use and that gas costs can be successfully amortized because trading strategies are executed on behalf of large user pools. Finally, we show that with modern layer-2 (L2) technologies, trades issued by the trading bot can be kept private, which means that algorithmic parameters are difficult to recover by a chain observer. With ChainBot, we develop a sample trading bot and train it on historical data, resulting in returns that are up to 2.4× and on average 1.4× the buy-and-hold strategy, which we use as our baseline. Our measurements show that across 1000 runs, the end-to-end average execution time for our system is 48.4 seconds. We demonstrate that the frequency of trading does not significantly affect the rate of return and Sharpe ratio, which indicates that we do not have to trade at every block, thereby significantly saving in terms of gas fees. In our implementation, a user who invests $1,000 would earn $105, and spend $3 on gas; assuming a user pool of 1,000 subscribers.",63,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ccb1383fc7ba7429536d44feb1486c0769cfb45f

Inefficient mobility in cities can lead to problems such as traffic congestion, which results in frustration for residents and a decrease in the quality of life. Against the backdrop of global warming, cities also strive to reduce CO2 emissions, an attempt which requires sustainable and novel mobility concepts. Blockchain is a current technology, said to have huge potential, that is being investigated for application in many facets of smart cities. In the context of smart mobility, blockchain can be used for transactions relating to ridesharing and electric charging, handling of interactions of platoon members, or serving as a foundation for communication between vehicles. Although initial research about this topic exists, it is distributed among different use-cases and applications. This article conducts a systematic literature review to analyze blockchain's role in mobility and transportation in smart cities, and its potential to increase efficiency in these areas. With this review, we aim to consolidate and summarize the current knowledge about this topic. As a first result, we present the findings from our literature review, which can be divided into five categories of use-cases. We also present a platform for further research about this emerging topic by identifying promising future research avenues. For this purpose, we derive a future research agenda based on our findings.",70,https://web.archive.org/web/20220502220134/https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sustainability/sustainability-13-13268/article_deploy/sustainability-13-13268-v2.pdf?version=1638322451

For these reasons, apart from information “in the public domain” or “basic scientific research”, transfers of nuclear technology are subject to export authorisation requirements and government-to-government assurances like the export of tangible goods, as specified by the Nuclear Suppliers Group’s guidelines and national export control laws.
Also the requirements of the Model Additional Protocol to the Agreement(s) between States and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards include declarations about national research and development activities related to the nuclear fuel cycle, but do not require declarations of technology transfers to third countries.
The European Commission JRC, in collaboration with Liege University, has developed the Tools for Innovation Monitoring Dual-use (TIM DU) platform that can facilitate the identification of entities publishing research with a dual-use potential in the various countries. Together with many dual-use goods and emerging technologies, TIM DU maps nuclear-fuel cycle activities’ results included in scientific abstracts, patents, and EU-funded projects, allowing analysts to gather lists of documents, geographical distributions, collaborations, and authors related to these activities.
These results can help the national authorities submitting declarations to IAEA in accordance with Additional Protocol’s Article 2.a, both to identify also previously unknown national research actors and their collaboration networks, as well as to raise the awareness of national research entities about potential sensitivities with external collaborators. The IAEA could also use TIM DU to support the verification of the completeness and correctness of the declarations concerning nuclear fuel cycle research",72,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/268522/1/2021.06_en_esarda_bulletin_online_-_catalogue.pdf

computational cost that would be caused by traditional consensus protocols. We
implement the AirCon protocol integrated into an LTE system and provide

For example, we securely compute the largest or smallest integer, the median, or in general the k th -ranked integer. Such computations are a useful building block to securely implement a variety of sealed-bid auctions. Our objective is efficiency, specifically low interactivity between parties to support blockchains or other scenarios where multiple rounds are time-consuming. Hence, we dismiss powerful, yet highlyinteractive MPC frameworks and propose BOREALIS, a special-purpose protocol for secure computation of ranks among integers. BOREALIS uses additively homomorphic encryption to implement core comparisons, but computes under distinct keys, chosen by each party to optimize the number of rounds. By carefully combining cryptographic primitives, such as ECC Elgamal encryption, encrypted comparisons, ciphertext blinding, secret sharing, and shuffling, BOREALIS sets up systems of multi-scalar equations which we efficiently prove with Groth-Sahai ZK proofs. Therewith, BOREALIS implements a multi-party computation of pairwise comparisons and rank zero-knowledge proofs secure against malicious adversaries. BOREALIS completes in at most 4 rounds which is constant in both bit length of integers and the number of parties n. This is not only asymptotically optimal, but surpasses generic constant-round secure multi-party computation protocols, even those based on shared-key fully homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, our implementation shows that BOREALIS is very practical. Its main bottleneck, ZK proof computations, is small in practice. Even for a large number of parties (n = 200) and high-precision integers ( = 32), computation time of all proofs is less than a single Bitcoin block interval.",79,https://web.archive.org/web/20220121002018/https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/276.pdf

A Prover can further demonstrate knowledge of a secret input that causes the Verifier’s program to satisfy certain assertions, without ever revealing which input was used. State-of-the-art Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (ZKPK) methods encode a computation using arithmetic circuits and preserve the privacy of Prover’s inputs while attesting the integrity of program execution.

Zilch uses traditional instruction sequences rather than static arithmetic circuits that would need to be regenerated for each different computation. Towards that end, we have implemented Z MIPS: a MIPS-like processor model that allows verifying each instruction independently and compose a proof for the execution of the target application. To foster usability, Zilch incorporates a novel cross-compiler from an object-oriented Java-like language tailored to ZKPK and optimized our Z MIPS model, as well as a powerful API that enables integration of ZKPK within existing C/C++ programs.

The proof can be based on any bit commitment scheme with a particular set of properties. We suggest an efficient implementation based on factoring. We also present a 4-move perfect zero-knowledge interactive argument for any NPlanguage L. On input x ∈ L, the communication complexity is O(|x|c) · max(k, l) bits, where l is the security parameter for the prover 1. Again, the protocol can be based on any bit commitment scheme with a particular set of properties. We suggest efficient implementations based on discrete logarithms or factoring. We present an application of our techniques to multiparty computations, allowing for example t committed oblivious transfers with error probability 2−k to be done simultaneously using O(t+k) commitments. Results for general computations follow from this. As a function of the security parameters, our protocols have the smallest known asymptotic communication complexity among general proofs or arguments for NP. Moreover, the constants involved are small enough for the protocols to be practical in a realistic situation: both protocols are based on a Boolean formula Φ containing and, orand not-operators which verifies an NP-witness of membership in L. Let n be the number of times this formula reads an input variable. Then the communication complexity of the protocols when using our concrete commitment schemes can be more precisely stated as at most 4n + k + 1 commitments for the interactive proof and at most 5nl+ 5l bits for the argument (assuming k ≤ l). Thus, if we use k = n, the number of commitments required for the proof is linear in n. Both protocols are also proofs of knowledge of an NP-witness of membership in the language involved. ∗Basic Research in Computer Science, Centre of the Danish National Research Foundation. 1The meaning of l is that if the prover is unable to solve an instance of a hard problem of size l before the protocol is finished, he can cheat with probability at most 2−k",94,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53219393e60ded223e461cbdd52d42e0b8263c8e

However, despite much research effort, all previous zero-knowledge proofs for them required either unproven complexity assumptions or an unbounded number of rounds of message exchange. For both (and similar) languages, we exhibit zeroknowledge proofs that require 5 rounds and no unproven assumptions. Our solution is essentially optimal, in this setting, due to a recent lower bound argument of Goldreich and Krawczyk. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Interactive proofs and especially zero-knowledge ones have found many applications, most notably in the field of secure protocols. In all such proofs, interaction is the crucial resource, as prover and verifier exchange messages in rounds. The fundamental problem here is whether the number of rounds induces a hierarchy. Tha t is, can we prove more languages in zero knowledge given more rounds? In a cryptographic sett ing the answer is no. But little is known for perfect zero-knowledge proofs. These are the ones tha t can be proven to be zero-knowledge without making use of unproven complexity assumptions. For this reason, perfect zero-knowledge is the right context for studying the intrinsic properties of this notion. There is a gap in what we are able to prove about perfect Zero-Knowledge (ZK): Goldreich and Krawczyk [3] * Suppo r t ed in pa r t by NSF g ran t CCR-87-19689. t S u p p o r t e d in pa r t by NSF g ran t DCR-84-13577 a n d A R O g ran t DAALO3-86-K-0171 .

On the other hand, the classic examples for perfect zero-knowledge, the languages of quadratic residuosity and graph isomorphism, required an unbounded number of rounds. In this paper we show T h e o r e m The languages of graph isomorphism and quadratic residuosity have 5 round perfect zero knowledge interactive proofs. More generally, we show that any random self-reducible language [7] has a 5 round perfect zero knowledge interactive proof. Perfect zero-knowledge works by carefully exploiting the structure of the problem at hand. It is important not only in practice (where we do not know which functions are one-way), but also in a theoretical setting. For example, our best way to prove that a language L, for which no efficient algorithm is known, is not NPcomplete involves exhibiting a perfect zero-knowledge proof for it [2]. Let us now see, at a very high level, why achieving perfect ZK in constant rounds is hard. Essentially, in a ZK proof, the confidence that a theorem is true is transferred by discrete amounts , or tokens. Each token consists of an elementary protocol that decreases the probabil i ty of error by a factor of, say, 2. Thus, after k tokens have been exchanged, this probabil i ty will be reduced to 2 -k . Tokens can be exchanged sequentially or in parallel ( that is concurrently). The ZK constraint implies that the messages exchanged for a single token can be simulated in expected polynomial time. Tha t is, a probabilistic, efficient simulator can output a token in expected, say, 2 trials without any intervention of the prover, and knowing nothing about the proof. Thus, if the proof transfers tokens one at a time, it is easy for the simulator to generate the view relative to k of them: in expected two trials the simulator will output a ""good"" first token; after that , in expected two more trials, will output a second ""good"" token, and so on. Thus, overall, the entire view of the protocol can be © 1990 ACM 089791-361-2/90/0005/0482 $1.50 482 simulated in expected 2k trials. If, however, the prover transfers tokens ""all together,"" the job of the simulator is much harder: the expected number of trials so that all k of them are simultaneously ""good,"" is 2 k. This phenomenon which will be made more precise in the context of graph isomorphism is what defeated researchers ever since ZK came about. The main result of this paper is a technique for squeezing the number of rounds in a interactive proof, while preserving simulatability. The proof of our main theorem involves several new ideas; in particular, a non-cryptographic committal scheme and a novel method of simulation in modes. In fact, although the protocol only requires 5 rounds and is surprisingly simple, the simulation argument is complex. Moreover, our result is essentially optimal due to the general 4-round lower bound of Goldreich and Krawczyk [3]. In this extended abstract we confine ourselves to a proof that graph isomorphism has a 5 round perfect zero knowledge interactive proof. 2 D e f i n i t i o n s 2 .1 P r o b a b i l i t y S p a c e s a n d A l g o r i t h m s These notations and conventions for probabilistic algorithms are derived from [6] and further extended. We emphasize the number of inputs received by an algorithm as follows. If algorithm A receives only one input we write ""A(.)""; if it receives two we write ""A(., .)"", and so on. If A is a probabilistic algorithm then, for any input i the notation A(i) refers to the probability space which to the string (r assigns the probability that A, on input i, outputs or. If S is a probability space we denote by Ps (e ) the probability that S associates with element e. We denote by IS] the set of elements to which S assigns positive probability. If f ( . ) and g( . , . . . ) are probabilistic algorithms then f ( g ( . , . . . ) ) is the probabilistic algorithm obtained by composing f and g (i.e. running f on g's output) . For any inputs x , y , . . , the associated probability space is denoted f (g (x , y , . . . ) ) . If 5: is a probability space then x *-S denotes the algorithm which assigns to x an element randomly selected according to S (that is, x is assigned the value e with probability P s ( e ) ) (in the case that [,9] consists of 3nly one element e we write x ~ e rather than x +--{e}). For probability spaces S, T . . . . , the notation P ( p ( x , y , . . . ) : x ~--S ; y ~--T ; . . . ) denotes the probability that the predicate p(x, y , . . . ) is true after the (ordered) execution of the algorithms x ~-S, y ~ T, etc. The notation f f ( x , y , . . . ) : x ~-S ; y *--7 "" ; . . . } t denotes the probability space which to the string ~r assigns the probability P(cr = f ( x , y , . . . ) : x *-S ; y *-T ; . . . ) , f being some function. If S is a finite set we will identify it with the probability space which assigns to each element of S the uniform probability U(S) = ]-~. (Then x ~-S denotes the operation of selecting an element of 5' uniformly at random, and Ps (e ) = U(S) for any e E S). We let P P T denote the set of probabilistic (expected) polynomial time algorithms. 2 . 2 I n t e r a c t i v e T M s a n d P r o t o c o l s Full descriptions of interactive Turing Machines and protocols appear in [5]; we will only summarize the notation we use. The probability that (A, B) accepts the common input x is denoted P ( ( A , B ) accepts x ) , and the probability space of all conversations between A and B on input x is denoted (A ~ B) (x ) (the probability in both cases is taken over the random tapes of both A and B). Sometimes we want to make the coin tosses of B explicit. For any R E {0, 1}* we write B ( R ) for the (deterministic) machine B with R as its random tape. Then (A ~-~ B (R) ) ( x ) denotes the probability space of conversations between A and B(R) on input x (the probability is over the random tapes of A). We let B(R;x ,oq131 . . . a i l f l i -1 ) denote the next message that B ( R ) sends when the conversation up to this point was cq/31 . . . oli_l~i_ 1. Finally, it is convenient to define the state of the ITM B at any point in its computation as consisting of the contents of its tapes, the positions of the heads on these tapes, and the internal state of the machine. 2 . 3 I n t e r a c t i v e P r o o f S y s t e m s a n d Z e r o K n o w l e d g e Def in i t i on 2.1 An interactive protocol (P, V) is an interactive proof system for the language L if the following conditions hold: • Completeness: For every x E L, P ( ( P , V) accepts x) > 1 2 -I~l .",98,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/972f94728a66449996be52af36e59c0d922528c0

repeatedly send data to all other nodes. For example, the nodes of a blockchain
network have to disseminate the blocks they create across the whole network.
The scientific literature typically takes the ideal perspective that such data
distribution is performed by broadcasting to all nodes directly, while in
practice data is distributed by repeated multicast. Since correctness and
security of consistency maintenance protocols usually have been established for
the ideal setting only, it is vital to show that these properties carry over to
real-world implementations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove that the ideal
and the real behavior are equivalent.
  In the work described in this paper, we take an important step towards such a
proof by proving a simpler variant of this equivalence statement. The
simplification is that we consider only a concrete pair of network topologies,
which nevertheless illustrates important phenomena encountered with arbitrary
topologies. For describing systems that distribute data, we use a
domain-specific language of processes that corresponds to a class of Petri nets
and is embedded in a general-purpose process calculus. This way, we can outline
our proof using an intuitive graphical notation and leverage the rich theory of
process calculi in the actual proof, which is machine-checked using the
