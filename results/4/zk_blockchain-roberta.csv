"Liz George,Jubilant J. Kizhakkethottam",Evolution of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) and its role in blockchain applications for ensuring data privacy,None,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"Last decade has witnessed a flourish in blockchain applications on account of the transparency, immutability and data privacy it offers. It allows users to act anonymously and perform transactions with high-end security. Counter measures to prevent various attacks that compromises the privacy of blockchain applications and improvising existing privacy mechanisms is the main concern in this area. Zero Knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique which has the potential to revolutionize the way data is collected, used and transacted with. It allows the user to hide the information that he possess but still able to prove its validity to others, thereby opens far-reaching prospects in the privacy preservation mechanism of blockchain applications. This paper gives an insight about the various Zero Knowledge Proof protocols like NIZKP, ZKRP, zk-SNARK, Bulletproof etc. that have evolved over time, and its role in privacy management in the era of blockchain. keywords blockchain, zero knowledge proof, privacy, cryptography _____________________________________________________________________________________________________",3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48b4db447aec8b8821ddbbb09d394bbf32d2e385

The importance of user and data privacy and confidentiality in blockchain technology is realized and is yet to be addressed by blockchain protocols. Zero-Knowledge-Proof can be the best solution to this problem. It is relatively new and is developing very rapidly.

As a cryptographic technique, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) can be used to verify whether the prover has enough transaction amount in the environment of blockchain without leaking any private transaction data. This article provides a comprehensive survey on ZKP in the environment of blockchain with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. It first discusses the framework, models and applications of ZKP. Next, it provides an introduction of blockchain, and proposes a framework of ZKP in the environment of blockchain.

So that the information contained in it can be easily known by unauthorized parties, and things like that are very detrimental. Until now, cryptography is one of the solutions to ensure the security of information. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol that can be used by someone to prove someone's ownership (prover) of confidential information to others (verifier), without the need to disclose the information or provide a way for other people to find out the secret. The test result is Zero Knowledge Proof divides one data stream into small blocks. Each of these blocks is encrypted separately. In an implementation without proof of knowledge, the key to encrypt will only be with the user, and by that, he will be able to encrypt and decrypt the information.

And it will cause the accumulation of data on the chain and resulting in the low efficiency of block verification, when the whole transaction on the chain is verified. In order to improve the efficiency and privacy protection of block data verification, this paper proposes an efficient block verification mechanism with privacy protection based on zeroknowledge proof (ZKP), which not only protects the privacy of users but also improves the speed of data block verification. There is no need to put the whole transaction on the chain when verifying block data. It just needs to generate the ZKP and root hash with the transaction information, then save them to the smart contract for verification. Moreover, the ZKP verification in smart contract is carried out to realize the privacy protection of the transaction and efficient verification of the block. When the data is validated, the buffer accepts the complete transaction, updates the transaction status in the cloud database, and packages up the chain. So, the ZKP strengthens the privacy protection ability of blockchain, and the smart contracts save the time cost of block verification.",13,https://web.archive.org/web/20221107202219/https://file.techscience.com/ueditor/files/csse/TSP_CSSE-45-2/TSP_CSSE_29622/TSP_CSSE_29622.pdf

Therefore, in order to verify the contents of all transactions, the data itself is compressed, but the scalability is limited. In addition, since a separate verification algorithm is used for each type of transaction, the verification burden increases as the size of the transaction increases. Existing blockchain cannot participate in the network because it does not become a block sink by using a server with a low specification. Due to this problem, as the time passes, the data size of the blockchain network becomes larger and it becomes impossible to participate in the network except for users with abundant resources. Therefore, in this paper, we are improved transaction as studied the zero knowledge proof algorithm for general operation verification. In this system, the design of zero-knowledge circuit generator capable of general operation verification and optimization of verifier and prover were also conducted.",22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66b60555e05b4556032df16174163a020b7d1883

Unfortunately, the former requires a trusted party while the latter does not exist. Blockchains are distributed systems that already exist and provide certain security properties (under some honest majority assumption), hence, a natural recent research direction has been to use a blockchain as an alternative setup assumption. In TCC 2017 Goyal and Goyal proposed a construction of a publicly verifiable zero-knowledge (pvZK) proof system for some proof-of-stake blockchains. The zero-knowledge property of their construction however relies on some additional and not fully specified assumptions about the current and future behavior of honest blockchain players. In this paper we provide several contributions. First, we show that when using a blockchain to design a provably secure protocol, it is dangerous to rely on demanding additional requirements on behaviors of the blockchain players. We do so by showing an ""attack of the clones"" whereby a malicious verifier can use a smart contract to slyly (not through bribing) clone capabilities of honest stakeholders and use those to invalidate the zero-knowledge property of the proof system by Goyal and Goyal. Second, we propose a new publicly verifiable zero-knowledge proof system that relies on noninteractive commitments and on an assumption on the min-entropy of some blocks appearing on the blockchain. Third, motivated by the fact that blockchains are a recent innovation and their resilience in the long run is still controversial, we introduce the concept of collapsing blockchain, and we prove that the zero-knowledge property of our scheme holds even if the blockchain eventually becomes insecure and all blockchain players eventually become dishonest.",31,https://web.archive.org/web/20210710182129/https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1435.pdf

However, current schemes are only aimed at blockchains with the UTXO model, and only one type of assets circulates on these blockchains.

The anonymous improvement scheme in this article uses the UTXO unconsumed model to add a new anonymous list in the blockchain. When sending assets to smart contracts, zero-knowledge proof is used to provide self-certification of ownership of the asset, and then the transaction is broken down. Only the hash value of the transaction is sent to the node, and the discarded list is used to verify the validity of the transaction, which achieves the effect of storing assets anonymously in the smart contract.

Therefore, in order to verify the contents of all transactions, the data itself is compressed, but the scalability is limited. In addition, since a separate verification algorithm is used for each type of transaction, the verification burden increases as the size of the transaction increases. Existing blockchain cannot participate in the network because it does not become a block sink by using a server with a low specification. Due to this problem, as the time passes, the data size of the blockchain network becomes larger and it becomes impossible to participate in the network except for users with abundant resources. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the zero knowledge proof algorithm for general operation verification. In this system, the design of zero-knowledge circuit generator capable of general operation verification and optimization of verifier and prover were also conducted.

Because it helps to transmit data in secure way over the Internet. So we need to use strong security method for secure data transaction. Cryptography is a security tool which helps to transmit information from one place to another place over computer network. Cryptography follows encryption and decryption methods for data transmission. Cryptographic technique is completely based on key generation because it needs keys to transmit data between users. However cryptography works well in secure data transmission but it needs keys to provide security for data. In cryptography generation of keys taking more time than transmission of data. So in this paper we discuss about Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) which is also based on cryptographic technique. ZKP is also useful in secure data transmission without sharing key values between users.

Protocols like Zcash are already providing the same for financial transactions but lacks flexibility required to apply in most of the potential use cases of blockchain. Most of the real world application work in a way where a transaction is carried out when a particular action is performed. Also, the zero knowledge proof method used in Zcash, ZKSNARK has certain weaknesses restricting its adoption. One of the major drawbacks of ZKSNARK is that it requires an initial trust setup phase which is difficult to achieve in blockchain ecosystem. ZKSTARK, an interactive zero knowledge proof does not require this phase and also provides security against post quantum attacks.

Therefore, many privacy enhancing technologies have been applied to DApp development, including zero knowledge proof (ZKP). This paper focuses on a particular kind of ZKP, called zero knowledge range proof (ZKRP), that has been applied in blockchain-based payments for banks. ZKRP allows a user to convince other people that a secret value actually lies within an interval without revealing any information about the secret. Here we introduce a new ZKRP which has the following remarkable features: (1) Non-interactive: No communication is required between a user and a verifier during the proof. (2) Range-flexibility: There is no limitation on the lower bound and the upper bound of the range except that they are natural numbers. (3) Efficiency: Our scheme is modified from that of Pang et al.

Although the blockchain system has been contunuously upgraded in recent years, current blockchain still has its deficiency in terms of node control and privacy protection. First of all, the high existence rate of malicious nodes in the chain made it difficult to well purify the network environment, meanwhile the malicious nodes cannot be easily dealt with. Secondly, the correlation between nodes can still be discovered through analysis. As a result, the privacy of users’ information cannot be well protected. This paper proposes a distributed identity authentication scheme based on Zero-knowledge proof, which uses face recognition technology to ensure the uniqueness and legitimacy of identity and control the generating of malicious nodes; Zero-knowledge proof algorithm is used to encrypt and support face data to prevent user identity information from being disclosed. At the same time, the linkable ring signature algorithm is adopted to confuse the correspondence between nodes and private information to further protect users’ privacy information.",67,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b2e38365f3b2b30514e5fdcc8b1f3ef56149db15

Wolf",Zero-Knowledge Systematization of Knowledge: Getting Blockchain Ready for Quantum Computers,None,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"Zero-knowledge proofs are protocols that allow a prover to convince a verifier that she has some secret information that satisfies some public requirement without revealing the secret itself (e.g., to prove that she is of age without revealing how old she is). Research in this area has been thriving in recent years, due to its applications in privacy-preserving technologies and in blockchain. However, the incumbent threat posed by quantum computers requires to switch gear: as many of the current protocols are not secure against large universal quantum computers, applications need to be ready to switch to newer protocols, so-called post-quantum, that are secure even in case of a quantum attack. This project aims to survey the current usage of zero-knowledge proofs in blockchains, with a particular focus on Zcash (https://z.cash/), and to assess vulnerability to quantum attacks. The final goal would be to identify requirements for post-quantum alternatives in terms of length of produced tokens and efficiency. Supervision. The student will work alongside dr. Cecilia Boschini, a Postdoc researcher in the Cryptography and Quantum Information group of Prof. Stefan Wolf. She has been doing research on post-quantum cryptography both in the academic and in the company environment (previously to USI, she was employed at IBM Research Zurich). Her knowledge of zero-knowledge proofs and of postquantum cryptography will help the student getting quickly comfortable with the topic. Requirements. This project would be a good introduction to a research topic in cryptography that has gained a lot of attention lately, due to its wide-spread applications. As such, familiarity with cryptography, security and blockchain at the time of starting the project is required. Quantum-safe Messaging: Security Assessment of the Signal Messaging App Dr. Cecilia Boschini, Prof. Stefan Wolf Abstract. Secure messaging relies on cryptography to guarantee both the integrity and the confidentiality of messages. The security of such building blocks comes from so called computational assumptions: they are secure if some mathematical problems are hard to solve. So far, this has been true: even the largest supercomputers would take decades before breaking such problems. However, the introduction of quantum computers has changed the paradigm: with universal, large enough quantum computer it will be possible to solve such problems in a short amount of time, thus breaking the security of the schemes. Quantum-safe alternatives (so-called post-quantum) are already available, and basic post-quantum cryptographic schemes are already in the process of being standardized. What is needed to use them in practice are security assessments: which part of the architecture of secure messaging apps is vulnerable, and what would it be necessary to fix it? The goal of this project is to analyze the security of a particular messaging app, Signal (https://www.signal.org/). Signal was chosen because of its security (arguably the best model among existing messaging apps), openness (the code and the architecture are open-source and peer-reviewed), and its commitment to an ethical and sustainable approach to security.

Code transformation engine for the highperformance computing library utopia. Abstract Utopia is an open source C++ library (bitbucket.org/zulianp/utopia) developed at ICS-USI in collaboration with CSCS (Swiss National Supercomputing Centre). The goal of this library is to provide hardware portable (CPU/GPU) codes for parallel algebra which can be employed for scientific simulations, optimization problems, and machine learning algorithms. Utopia is currently being used in several PASC (pasc-ch.org) projects such as FASTER, AV-Flow, and StagBL. The main goal of this project is to implement a system for performing code transformations from small python code snippets to C/C++ code. This generated code is compiled just in time, and will run on acceleration hardware such as multicore CPUs and GPUs. This will allow utopia-python users to extend functionalities without the need of diving into complex C++ code nor sacrificing performance. The project focus will be on Python to C/C++ automated translation, code transformation, and just in time compilation. During the course of this project the student will: • work independently on specific development goals; • research the state of the art in scientific software; • participate in developing open-source community codes; • interact with developers and users; • learn and use basic concepts of C++; • use the GIT version control system, CMake/Makefile build systems, and Docker containers; • implement a simple simulation tool using the developed tools.",71,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0968f16514811d961c271453eeed0867c13621d

In addition to their direct applicability in cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs serve as a good benchmark for the study of various problems regarding cryptographic protocols (e.g., ""secure composition of protocols"" and the ""use of of the adversary's program within the proof of security"").

S. Atapoor,On Privacy Preserving Blockchains and zk-SNARKs,None,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"During last few years, along with blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies have found huge attention from both commercial and scientific perspectives. Cryptocurrencies are digital coins which use cryptographic tools to allow secure peer-to-peer monetary transactions. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency that allows direct payments between pseudonyms without any third party. If a user’s pseudonym is linked to her identity, all her transactions will be traceable, which will violate her privacy. To address this, various privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies have been proposed that use different cryptographic tools to achieve anonymous transactions. Zerocash is one of the most popular ones that uses zero-knowledge proofs to hide the source, destination and value of each transaction. This thesis consists of two main parts. In the first part, after a short overview of some cryptocurrencies (precisely Bitcoin, Monero and Zerocoin), we will explain the construction of Zerocash cryptocurrency and discuss the intuition behind the construction. More precisely, we will introduce the deployed primitives and will discuss the role of each primitive in the construction of the coin. In particular, we explain zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (a.k.a. zk-SNARKs) that play the main role in achieving strong privacy in Zerocash. Due to the importance of zk-SNARKs in privacy-preserving applications, in the second part of the thesis, we will present a new variation of Groth’s 2016 zk-SNARK that currently is the most efficient pairing-based scheme. The main difference between the proposed variation and the original one is that unlike the original version, new variation guarantees nonmalleability of generated proofs. Our analysis shows that the proposed changes have minimal effects on the efficiency of the original scheme and particularly it outperforms Groth and Maller’s 2017 zk-SNARK that also guarantees non-malleability of proofs.",77,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ccf478277957ede01d6846a68070898cce554cfe

The advantage of using the blockchain for record keeping is that participants can freely record the information at their discretion, without any restrictions. However, the openness of the blockchain may allow a malicious third party to introduce disinformation. In this study, we employ ZKP and near-field communication (NFC) chips to eliminate the possibility of disinformation introduction. ZKP is used to prove/validate changes in the state of wood objects, and the unique nonce associated with that state is encrypted and recorded on an NFC chip. The nonce is concealed and id of the wood object is defined as hash value of this nonce. We developed a prototype system based on an Android application and an Ethereum smart contract. We confirm that wood traceability and verification can be performed using the prototype system.",91,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8250af4bb3e863ab82e7c7519277044dd1a65d80

system to maintain transactions. By benefiting from the concept of
decentralized ledger, users who do not know or trust each other can still
conduct transactions in a peer-to-peer manner. Inspired by Bitcoin, other
cryptocurrencies were invented in recent years such as Ethereum, Dash, Zcash,
Monero, Grin, etc. Some of these focus on enhancing privacy for instance crypto
note or systems that apply the similar concept of encrypted notes used for
transactions to enhance privacy (e.g., Zcash, Monero). However, there are few
mechanisms to support the exchange of privacy-enhanced notes or assets on the
chain, and at the same time preserving the privacy of the exchange operations.
Existing approaches for fair exchanges of assets with privacy mostly rely on
off-chain/side-chain, escrow or centralized services. Thus, we propose a
solution that supports oblivious and privacy-protected fair exchange of crypto
notes or privacy enhanced crypto assets. The technology is demonstrated by
extending zero-knowledge based crypto notes. To address ""privacy"" and
""multi-currency"", we build a new zero-knowledge proving system and extend note
format with new property to represent various types of tokenized assets or
cryptocurrencies. By extending the payment protocol, exchange operations are
realized through privacy enhanced transactions (e.g., shielded transactions).
Based on the possible scenarios during the exchange operation, we add new
constraints and conditions to the zero-knowledge proving system used for
validating transactions publicly.",95,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06535v1

They are the number of envelopes used in the protocol, the number of oblivious transfer protocols executed during the protocol, and the total amount of communication required by the protocol. It is shown that after a preprocessing stage consisting of O(k) executions of oblivious transfer, any polynomial number of NP-theorems of any polysize can be proved noninteractively and in zero knowledge, on the basis of the existence of any one-way function, so that the probability of accepting a false theorem is less than 1/2/sup k/.<<ETX>>",98,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9402e161c7ab04346d70a4430ad5c4d9c8c6f2d8
"Aayush Gupta,N. Kaashoek,Brice Wang,Jason Zhao",Zero-Knowledge Battleship,None,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"The last decade has seen tremendous growth in both the adoption and understanding of public ledger technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As these cryptocurrencies have risen in popularity, other ideas have also seen a rise in prominence due to a perceived relevance to the blockchain. One example of this is Zero Knowledge Proofs. While they were first conceived of in 1989 by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff[1], they have gained more attention recently. However, there seems to be a lack of consensus as to where they are best used. We designed an example application whose backbone runs entirely on the blockchain with the support of zero-knowledge proofs. In doing so, we investigated the usefulness, ease of adoption, and practicality of these proofs. For our sample application, we settled on the classic game of Battleship. We implemented our game in an entirely decentralized manner, using zero-knowledge proofs to validate the moves made by each player, and the blockchain as the only “backend” of the system. We successfully achieved our goal of implementing a proof-of-concept that delivers upon these goals, providing evidence to the usefulness of zkps. Along with our implementation, we developed a strong understanding of the state of zeroknowledge proofs in the modern world, analyzing both their strengths and weaknesses. Our proofof-concept demonstrates that zero-knowledge applications are viable and practical for certain uses, but also exposed particular problems in using the blockchain for real-time applications. However, we feel that this could be addressed with relatively minor modifications, and does very little to diminish the usefulness of the actual zero-knowledge proofs.",99,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a80c00830a5b67af37111680f3e15938b6851674
