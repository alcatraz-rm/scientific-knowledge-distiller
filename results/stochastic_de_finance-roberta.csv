"Mguni, David H.",Strategically-Timed Actions in Stochastic Differential Games,2020-08-28 00:00:00,SupportedSources.CORE,,"Financial systems are rich in interactions amenable to description by stochastic control theory. Optimal stochastic control theory is an elegant mathematical framework in which a controller, profitably alters the dynamics of a stochastic system by exercising costly control inputs. If the system includes more than one agent, the appropriate modelling framework is stochastic differential game theory — a multiplayer generalisation of stochastic control theory. There are numerous environments in which financial agents incur fixed minimal costs when adjusting their investment positions; trading environments with transaction costs and real options pricing are important examples. The presence of fixed minimal adjustment costs produces adjustment stickiness as agents now enact their investment adjustments over a sequence of discrete points. Despite the fundamental relevance of adjustment stickiness within economic theory, in stochastic differential game theory, the set of players’ modifications to the system dynamics is mainly restricted to a continuous class of controls. Under this assumption, players modify their positions through infinitesimally fine adjustments over the problem horizon. This renders such models unsuitable for modelling systems with fixed minimal adjustment costs. To this end, we present a detailed study of strategic interactions with fixed minimal adjustment costs. We perform a comprehensive study of a new stochastic differential game of impulse control and stopping on a jump-diffusion process and, conduct a detailed investigation of two-player impulse control stochastic differential games. We establish the existence of a value of the games and show that the value is a unique (viscosity) solution to a double obstacle problem which is characterised in terms of a solution to a non-linear partial differential equation (PDE). The study is contextualised within two new models of investment that tackle a dynamic duopoly investment problem and an optimal liquidity control and lifetime ruin problem. It is then shown that each optimal investment strategy can be recovered from the equilibrium strategies of the corresponding stochastic differential game. Lastly, we introduce a dynamic principal-agent model with a self-interested agent that faces minimally bounded adjustment costs. For this setting, we show for the first time that the principal can sufficiently distort that agent’s preferences so that the agent finds it optimal to execute policies that maximise the principal’s payoff in the presence of fixed minimal costs",27,https://core.ac.uk/download/336580919.pdf

They play an important role in a growing range of applications in finance,

established via moment determinacy in combination with pathwise uniqueness.
Existence boils down to a stochastic invariance problem that we solve for

There is an interplay between stochastic control and mathematics of finance. On the one hand stochastic control is a powerful tool to study financial problems. On the other hand financial applications have stimulated development in several research subareas of stochastic control in the last two decades. We start with pricing of financial derivatives and modeling of asset prices, studying the conditions for the absence of arbitrage. Then we consider pricing of defaultable contingent claims. Investments in bonds lead us to the term structure modeling problems. Special attention is devoted to historical static portfolio analysis called Markowitz theory. We also briefly sketch dynamic portfolio problems using viscosity solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, martingale-convex analysis method or stochastic maximum principle together with backward stochastic differential equation.

contract on an underlying asset. Here we consider option pricing in the partial
differential equations framework. The contemporary models lead to
one-dimensional or multidimensional parabolic problems of the
convection-diffusion type and generalizations thereof. An overview of various
operator splitting methods is presented for the efficient numerical solution of
these problems.
  Splitting schemes of the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) type are
discussed for multidimensional problems, e.g. given by stochastic volatility
(SV) models. For jump models Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) methods are considered
which efficiently treat the nonlocal jump operator. For American options an
easy-to-implement operator splitting method is described for the resulting
linear complementarity problems.
  Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the actual stability and
convergence of the splitting schemes. Here European and American put options
are considered under four asset price models: the classical Black-Scholes
model, the Merton jump-diffusion model, the Heston SV model, and the Bates SV
model with jumps.",63,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01022v1

"Guohui Guan,Zongxia Liang",Optimal management of DC pension plan in a stochastic interest rate and stochastic volatility framework,2014-01-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.INTERNET_ARCHIVE,10.1016/j.insmatheco.2014.05.004,"This paper investigates an optimal investment strategy of DC pension plan in a stochastic interest rate and stochastic volatility framework. We apply an affine model including the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and the Vasicek mode to characterize the interest rate while the stock price is given by the Heston's stochastic volatility (SV) model. The pension manager can invest in cash, bond and stock in the financial market. Thus, the wealth of the pension fund is influenced by the financial risks in the market and the stochastic contribution from fund participant. The goal of the fund manager is, coping with the contribution rate, to maximize the expectation of the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility of the terminal value of the pension fund over a guarantee which serves as an annuity after retirement. We first transform the problem into a single investment problem, then derive explicit solution via stochastic programming method. Finally, numerical analysis is given to show the impact of financial parameters on the optimal strategies. Submission Classifications: IE53, IE13, IB13, IE12. JEL Classifications: C61,G11, G32.
