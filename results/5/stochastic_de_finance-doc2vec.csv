Various authors have argued that security returns are not homoskedastic but exhibit variation over time. They have observed that large changes tend be followed by more large changes in either direction, and so volatility must be predictably high after large changes. This phenomenon of securities' volatility, referred to as clustering, has important implications for security pricing and risk management. Among the most popular techniques currently used to capture the clustering effect and to forecast future volatilityare those belonging to the family of Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) models. The main aim of this paper is to investigate whether such volatility modelling can be used to capture the time variation not only in the total risk of a security return but also its systematic and unsystematic components. Using weekly local stock market data, the time varying beta with the World Index has been estimated via a bivariate GARCH-M model. The GARCH-M parameterization used here is a dynamic specification of the SIM. The hypothesis that this dynamic specification holds cannot be rejected for 11 out of 13 local portfolios. The results provide evidence that both the systematic and the non-systematic counterparts are also changing over time. However, in some markets those risk changes may take place with some delay. This suggests that some of the low correlation coefficients computed for certain stock market returns may not be due to differences in business cycles among those countries, but may be caused by the non-synchronous response to world market developments. This finding should have important implications in many investment decisions such as portfolio selection, market timing and risk hedging.",23,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27179cc99a8f50da4252ebb0c967b15f36687bca

microstructure model designed to be a good compromise between accuracy and
tractability. The stock price is driven by a Markov Renewal Process (MRP),
while market orders arrive in the limit order book via a point process
correlated with the stock price itself. In this framework, we can reproduce the
adverse selection risk, appearing in two different forms: the usual one due to
big market orders impacting the stock price and penalizing the agent, and the
weak one due to small market orders and reducing the probability of a
profitable execution. We solve the market making problem by stochastic control
techniques in this semi-Markov model. In the no risk-aversion case, we provide
explicit formula for the optimal controls and characterize the value function
as a simple linear PDE. In the general case, we derive the optimal controls and
the value function in terms of the previous result, and illustrate how the risk
aversion influences the trader strategy and her expected gain. Finally, by
using a perturbation method, approximate optimal controls for small risk
aversions are explicitly computed in terms of two simple PDE's, reducing
drastically the computational cost and enlightening the financial

We derive macroscopic equations based on the microscopic herding interactions of agents and find that they are able to reproduce various stylized facts of different markets and different assets with the same set of model parameters. We show that the power-law properties and the scaling of return intervals and other financial variables have a similar origin and could be a result of a general class of non-linear stochastic differential equations derived from a master equation of an agent system that is coupled by herding interactions. Specifically, we find that this approach enables us to recover the volatility return interval statistics as well as volatility probability and spectral densities for the NYSE and FOREX markets, for different assets, and for different time-scales. We find also that the historical S\&P500 monthly series exhibits the same volatility return interval properties recovered by our proposed model.

profile which implies that a strong Allee effect exists in the stochastic

the total population size goes to infinity. Stochasticity vanishes and the
model becomes deterministic as the total population size goes to infinity. This
implies that there is only one possible fate (either to die out or survive) for
a species constrained to a specific community and whether population eventually
goes extinct or persists does not depend on initial population density but on a
critical inherent constant determined by birth, death and mate limitation. Such
a conclusion interprets differently from the classical ordinary differential

Diego Zabaljauregui,Optimal Market Making Under Partial Information and Numerical Methods for Impulse Control Games with Applications,2019-06-01 00:00:00,SupportedSources.SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR,,"The topics treated in this thesis are inherently two-fold. The first part considers the problem of a market maker who wants to optimally set bid/ask quotes over a finite time horizon, to maximize her expected utility. The intensities of the orders she receives depend not only on the spreads she quotes, but also on unobservable factors modelled by a hidden Markov chain. This stochastic control problem under partial information is solved by means of stochastic filtering, control and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes theory. The value function is characterized as the unique continuous viscosity solution of its dynamic programming equation. Afterwards, the analogous full information problem is solved and results are compared numerically through a concrete example. The optimal full information spreads are shown to be biased when the exact market regime is unknown, as the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty in terms of P&L sensitivity and observable order ow volatility. 
 
The second part deals with numerically solving nonzero-sum stochastic differential games with impulse controls. These offer a realistic and far-reaching modelling framework for applications within finance, energy markets and other areas, but the diffculty in solving such problems has hindered their proliferation. Semi-analytical approaches make strong assumptions pertaining very particular cases. To the author's best knowledge, there are no numerical methods available in the literature. A policy-iteration-type solver is proposed to solve an underlying system of quasi-variational inequalities, and it is validated numerically with reassuring results. In particular, it is observed that the algorithm does not enjoy global convergence and a heuristic methodology is proposed to construct initial guesses. 
 
Eventually, the focus is put on games with a symmetric structure and a substantially improved version of the former algorithm is put forward. A rigorous convergence analysis is undertaken with natural assumptions on the players strategies, which admit graph-theoretic interpretations in the context of weakly chained diagonally dominant matrices. A provably convergent single-player impulse control solver, often outperforming classical policy iteration, is also provided. The main algorithm is used to compute with high precision equilibrium payoffs and Nash equilibria of otherwise too challenging problems, and even some for which results go beyond the scope of all the currently available theory.",72,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f3ee5b6b705b08186a9b0e9ec0430e6ccca67312

We connect ideas from conventional techniques -- like historical and Monte Carlo simulation -- and we come up with a hybrid method that shares the advantages of standard procedures but eliminates several of their drawbacks. Instead of considering the static problem of constructing one or ten day ahead distributions for vectors of risk factors, we embed the problem into a dynamic framework, where any time horizon can be consistently simulated. Additionally, we use standard models from mathematical finance for each risk factor, whence bridging the worlds of trading and risk management. Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), like the HJM-equation or the Black-Scholes equation, governing the time evolution of risk factors, on an empirical calibration method to the market for the chosen SDEs, and on an Euler scheme (or high-order schemes) for the numerical evaluation of the respective SDEs. The empirical calibration procedure presented in this paper can be seen as the SDE-counterpart of the so called Filtered Historical Simulation method; the behavior of volatility stems in our case out of the assumptions on the underlying SDEs.

Collaborators: Oliver Chen, Alexey Kuznetzov, Stephan Lawi. Speaker: Dirk Becherer (Imperial College London) Title: On general futures prices in supermartingale term structure models Abstract: Futures are among the practically most important and liquidly traded instruments. There is a vast literature on them with many articles, and also excellent treatment in textbooks on mathematical finance by Björk, Duffie, and Hunt & Kennedy, among others. Nevertheless, the literature about theoretical models on futures appears technically rather less developed and mathematically elaborated than other areas of mathematical finance, like equities, credit risk, or interest rate theory. This talk is concerned with general futures prices in framework of semimartingale pricing kernel models with positive interest, i.e. supermartingale pricing models. We show how recent results on supermartingale term structure models in connection with stochastic backward integration allow for a general and unifying view on discretely and continuously resettled contingent claims, and also reveal the natural martingale structure behind the appropriate numeraires for obtaining the futures price process. The analysis does not need to assume a Brownian filtration or continuous martingales. And for key results, one does not need to assume the existence of a classical savings account either. Speaker: Antje Berndt (Cornell University) Title: Measuring default risk premia from default swap rates and EDFs Abstract: This paper estimates recent default risk premia for U.S. corporate debt, based on a close relationship between default probabilities, as estimated by the Moody’s KMV EDF measure, and market default swap (CDS) rates. The default-swap data, obtained by CIBC from a large number of dealers and bank counterparties, allow us to establish a strong link between actual and risk-neutral default probabilities for",86,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b414a765873088b9e33e99be436b7b87d0cb674c
"Kumah, F.",Unanticipated money and the demand for foreign assets : a rational expectations approach,None,SupportedSources.CORE,,"This paper is an attempt at empirically investigating one of the building blocks of the foreign exchange market - the demand for foreign financial assets - under two alternative monetary policy rules (the fixed rate of growth of money rule and the feedback monetary policy rule) using time series data for Germany over the period 1974:1 - 1992:4. The approach adopted here offers us the opportunity of investigating the impact of monetary policy shocks on the demand for foreign assets. It turns out that the data-set picks the feedback monetary policy rule as characterising the data generation process better. Based on this feedback policy rule roughly 23% of monetary policy shocks have permanent effects (and the remaining percentage of these shocks exhibit transitory effects) on the demand for foreign assets. Our empirical results indicate, among others, that unanticipated monetary policy shocks and increases in the interest rate differential drive German investors abroad whereas domestic interest rate increases and currency depreciations demonstrate the ""safe-haven"" effect (that is to say domestic investors prefer having their investments in assets denominated in Deutsche Marks).",87,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6259115.pdf

Specific examples are the Heston and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models with square root coefficients and the Ait-Sahalia model with rational coefficient f unctions. Simple examples show that, for example, the Euler-Maruyama scheme may not converge either in the strong or weak sense when the standard assumptions do not hold. Nevertheless, new convergence results have been obtained recently for many such models in financial mathematics. These are reviewed here. Although weak convergence is of traditional importance in financial mathematics with its emphasis on expectations of functionals of the solutions, strong convergence plays a crucial role in Multi Level Monte Carlo methods, so it and also pathwise convergence will be considered along with methods which preserve the positivity of the solutions.",89,"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/878f060b20796e3f27e412e34b30d2f8a642d490

for the Monte Carlo pricing of derivatives in LIBOR market models. Standard
methods can be applied to solve the stochastic differential equations of the
successive LIBOR rates but the methods are generally slow. Our contribution is
twofold. Firstly, we propose an alternative approximation scheme based on
Picard iterations. This approach is similar in accuracy to the Euler
discretization, but with the feature that each rate is evolved independently of
the other rates in the term structure. This enables simultaneous calculation of
derivative prices of different maturities using parallel computing. Secondly,
the product terms occurring in the drift of a LIBOR market model driven by a
jump process grow exponentially as a function of the number of rates, quickly
rendering the model intractable. We reduce this growth from exponential to
quadratic using truncated expansions of the product terms. We include numerical
illustrations of the accuracy and speed of our method pricing caplets,
swaptions and forward rate agreements.",91,"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.3362v2

An important class of computational problems include so-called integro-differential equations which include both integrals and derivatives of a function. In another example, stochastic differential equations can be written in terms of a partial differential equation of a probability density function of the stochastic variable. To learn characteristics of the stochastic variable based on the density function, specific integral transforms, namely moments, of the density function need to be calculated. Recently, the machine learning paradigm of Physics-Informed Neural Networks emerged with increasing popularity as a method to solve differential equations by leveraging automatic differentiation. In this work, we propose to augment the paradigm of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with automatic integration in order to compute complex integral transforms on trained solutions, and to solve integro-differential equations where integrals are computed on-the-fly during training. Furthermore, we showcase the techniques in various application settings, numerically simulating quantum computer-based neural networks as well as classical neural networks.",92,https://web.archive.org/web/20220709035350/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14184v1.pdf

Does modelling stochastic interest rates, beyond stochastic volatility, improve pricing performance on long-dated commodity derivatives? To answer this question, we consider futures price models for commodity derivatives that allow for stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rates and a correlation structure between the underlying variables. We examine the empirical pricing performance of these models on pricing long-dated crude oil derivatives. Estimating the model parameters from historical crude oil futures prices and option prices, we find that stochastic interest rate models improve pricing performance on long-dated crude oil derivatives, when the interest rate volatility is relatively high. Furthermore, increasing the model dimensionality does not tend to improve the pricing performance on long-dated crude oil option prices, but it matters for long-dated futures prices. We also find empirical evidence for a negative correlation between crude oil futures prices and interest rates that contributes to improving fit to long-dated crude oil option prices",95,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/115328/4/JBF_SICommod.pdf

We show that our integration formula approaches the Euler formula if the Poissonian noise approaches the Gaussian white noise. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are examined by studying the dynamics of an overdamped particle driven by Poissonian white shot noise in a spatially periodic potential. We find that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm only weakly depends on the parameters characterizing the Poissonian white shot noise; this holds true even if the limit of Gaussian white noise is approached.",96,https://web.archive.org/web/20170808131606/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/Talkner/Papers/Kim_PRE_2007.pdf

Thus, a collocation method based on sixth-kind Chebyshev polynomials (SKCPs) is introduced to assess their numerical solutions. This collocation approach reduces the considered problem to a system of linear algebraic equations. The convergence and error analysis of the suggested scheme are investigated.
