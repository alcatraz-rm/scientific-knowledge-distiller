For example, decentralized man-\nagement is very useful for organizing digital assets produced by vari-\nous institutions (eg, biomedical data, software, and \u201crecipes\u201d or\nworkflows frequently used in predictive modeling and analytics).\nThis allows operations without a hub (ie, no single point of\n\u201cownership\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d). This characteristic is especially attrac-\ntive for applications in which users prefer not to rely on a single cen-\ntral authority (eg, federated clinical data networks for quality\nimprovement, health insurance operations, cross-institutional con-\nsent management without the need for a coordinating center) and in\nwhich users want to verify the use of their assets. Another advantage\nis the recording of data provenance, which can be vital in applica-\ntions such as clinical decision support and surveillance systems. This\nis possible because of blockchain creates an immutable audit trail\nthat permanently records transactions, so that critical records (eg,\nprotected patient information access log) are always available for all\nin the network to inspect. Figure 1 shows simple examples of how a\n\u201cblock\u201d of transactions (eg, clinical or trial data access records)\ncould be mounted to a blockchain for recording healthcare and research transactions. Our published tutorial on blockchain2 summa-\nrizes some key blockchain benefits that are important for health\nsciences and can serve as a first introduction for readers who are\ncompletely unfamiliar with the technology.\nBlockchain components to support healthcare\napplications The basic blockchain technology components that support healthcare applications have been introduced in several recent studies,1,2,25\nincluding the use of hash-chain timestamping and consensus proto-\ncols such as Proof of Work (PoW). To solve the scalability issue (ie,\nthe size of the whole blockchain grows proportionally to the number of transactions), there are 3 techniques:1 Merkle tree26\u201328 (Figure 2),\nlightweight nodes (Figure 3), and unspent transaction output\n(Figure 4). As a distributed network, blockchain faces some challenges,29 such as the famous Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem, a syn-\nchronization problem illustrated in Figure 5. Technical details on\nhow to use the metadata of transactions to store data records and\nusing smart contracts to manage digital assets on a blockchain are explained in Supplementary Appendix S22\u20134,30\u201335 and Supplementary Appendix S1,25,36 respectively."

            "text": "Blockchain platforms adopted in healthcare\napplications To initiate the design and building of a real-world healthcare block-\nchain project, one of the critical steps is to select the most suitable\nunderlying blockchain platform. The 3 main platforms are the fol-\nlowing.\nEthereum. MedRec37,38 and Patientory39,40 propose the use of a blockchain based on the Ethereum platform25 for patient-managed\nhealth information exchange applications. Nebula Genomics pro-\nposes to share and analyze genomic data on an Ethereum-based blockchain platform.41 Ethereum was also proposed to be adopted in clinical applications such as clinical data sharing15 and automated remote patient monitoring.42\nHyperledger. An oncology clinical data sharing framework10 for patient care proposes to adopt the Hyperledger platform.43 Also,\nHyperledger was included in the design of a framework to enforce Institutional Review Board regulations.11 Additionally, Hyperledger is proposed for a mobile healthcare application44 and for medical data storage or access45 applications. A working group was formed\nby Hyperledger to cultivate technical or business collaborations for healthcare blockchain applications.46\nMultiChain. ModelChain29 was used to accelerate research and\nfacilitate quality improvement initiatives by supporting decentral-\nized cross-institutional predictive modeling. The use of blockchain\nin ModelChain makes it possible for different institutions to im-\nprove predictive power by contributing data to a jointly developed\nmodel without transmitting data or the model to a central location.\nThe first implementation of ModelChain used a permissioned blockchain MultiChain,31 and was applied for predictive analytics in anesthesia.47\nThese examples constitute early work in this area and attempt to\nshow the feasibility of adopting popular, open-source blockchain\nplatforms for health or medicine. There are also some health-related\nblockchain applications that do not explicitly reveal their underlying platforms, such as Luna DNA,48 a proposed genomic and medical research database (with similar goals as those of Nebula Genomics).49\nOthers may be building an in-house blockchain. However, it is more\ncost effective, time efficient, and sustainable to adopt an off-the-shelf\nblockchain platform in the early design and development stages, to\nensure feasibility and demonstrate an operational system before large\ninvestments are made in recreating existing platforms.\nChallenges of selecting a blockchain platform for\nhealthcare Choosing a proper off-the-shelve blockchain platform for a specific\nhealthcare or clinical application may be challenging, because there\nis a wide range of technical features that are critical for its adoption\nin healthcare projects. For example, there are concerns that adopting blockchain would consume too much energy, unnecessarily.50 This\nconcern should not be about blockchain itself, but instead reflects\nlack of understanding of various block-building consensus protocols\nthat can be selected for a specific blockchain platform. PoW, used in\nBitcoin, consumes a lot of energy, but other consensus protocols do\nnot. Other concerns involve the openness of a blockchain network\n(eg, public or private), ability to modify the code and distribute it\n(eg, licenses), and need for specific hardware (eg, SGX-enabled\nprocessors).\nThere are many choices of blockchain platform available today,\nsuch as Ethereum, Hyperledger, and MultiChain, mentioned previ-\nously. A blockchain platforms should be general (ie, not limited to\nfinancial applications) and popular (ie, technically mature and with\nample community support to ensure future maintenance). Although\nsome platforms may not have been adopted in the healthcare do-\nmain so far, they might be considered in the future because of desir-\nable technical features (eg, support for an energy-efficient consensus\nprotocol).\nThe need for a review of blockchain platforms for\nhealthcare or clinical informatics To address the difficulties of blockchain platform selection for\nhealthcare or clinical applications, a systematic comparison of these\nplatforms in terms of their technical features is critical. Although there are broad reviews of blockchain platforms,51,52 of blockchain\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/26/5/462/5419321 by guest on 15 O ctober 2022\nresearch frameworks,53 and systematic reviews of blockchain technology articles,4 a systematic comparison of blockchain platforms\nthat are relevant for healthcare is still lacking. Such systematic com-\nparison can serve as a practical reference for healthcare blockchain\nresearchers and application designers to choose the appropriate plat-\nform for their specific use case (eg, public health, administration,\nclinical care), especially, as mentioned previously, in the setting of\nhealthcare or research institutions that prefer not to cede control to\na central authority but want to work together.\nObjective The objective of this study is to compare the most popular block-\nchain platforms using a systematic method, considering the tech-\nnical features that are relevant to healthcare applications, and to\nprovide a reference for selection of suitable blockchain plat-\nforms for specific requirements encountered in healthcare and\nbiomedicine."

We excluded\ncryptocurrencies that could not serve as a general-purpose ledger, as\nthey are less important for biomedical informatics applications. This\nway, the results of the systematic comparison could be utilized in\nhealthcare or clinical application areas such as population health,\nbiomedical and health services research, and healthcare administration. We utilized Google.com58 as our main search engine, and con-\nducted all searches in July 2017. No major blockchain technology\nhas emerged as of November 2018.\nSearch We used the phrase blockchain platforms as the initial search term\nin Google.com. Realizing that the returning results were mostly\nabout either \u201cdiscussion of multiple blockchain platforms\u201d or\n\u201cgeneral introduction of blockchain\u201d (instead of the platforms\nthemselves), we manually reviewed the top 30 ranked webpages\nreturned by Google.com, and identified webpages that discussed\nmore than 1 blockchain platform. We then collected all the block-\nchain platforms names found in these webpages into a candidate list\n(see the identification phase in Figure 6).\nPlatform selection To select the platforms names from the candidate list, we first re-\nmoved all the duplicated blockchain platforms. Next, we aimed at\n\u201cpopular\u201d blockchain platforms, because blockchain is still an\nemerging technology and the widely used platforms are in general\nmore mature in terms of the technical development, community sup-\nport, and long-term maintenance. Intuitively, we could have used\nthe Google Count (ie, the number of webpages returned by search-\ning the platform name, such as \u201cBitcoin,\u201d using Google.com) to\nrank the popularity of the platforms. However, we realized that,\nwhile certain platform names were specific to the blockchain field\n(eg, \u201cEthereum\u201d), other platform names were more general (eg,\n\u201cDash\u201d). Thus, using just the Google Count of platform names\nmight unfairly bias the results in favor of more general names.\nTo mitigate the bias introduced by common names, our strategy\nwas to first determine whether a platform name was a dictionary\nword or not, using the following 2 online dictionary websites:\nBlock B1\nHash of Block B0 Header...\nTransaction T11\nBlock B2\nHash of Block B1 Header ...\nTransaction T21 Transaction T22\n(a)\nNonce N1 Nonce N2\nTransaction T12\nBlock B1\nHash of Block B0 Header\nMerkle Root (Hash of T11-18)\nHash of T13-14Hash of T11-12\nHash of T11-14\nM er\nkl e\nTr ee\n(b)\nNonce N1\nHash of T12Hash of T11\nT13T11\nHash of T14Hash of T13\nT14\nHash of T17-18Hash of T15-16\nHash of T15-18\nHash of T16Hash of T15\nT16T15\nHash of T18Hash of T17\nT18T17T12\nBlock B0 Block B2\nFigure 2. To reduce storage, if a block B is \u201cvoted\u201d to be correct because the chain is long enough (ie, there are already many blocks created after B), we can discard the transactions contained in B, without changing the hash of B\u2019s header (otherwise all blocks after B would need to be changed). To do this, instead of saving the content of all transactions directly in a block, we first compute the hash values of each transaction, and then construct a tree structure (a Merkle tree),26\u201328 to \u201ccombine\u201d (ie, hash again) all hash values, and store only the Merkle Root hash value at the block header. This way we can prune the transactions in the tree later, without changing the Merkle Root and the block header. In other words, the size of the blockchain is now proportional to the number of blocks instead of being proportional to the number of transactions. (A) An example blockchain without a Merkle tree. The blocks enclose transactions without adopting a Merkle tree. As a result, the size of a block will grow proportionally to the number of transactions (eg, transaction T12) that are enclosed. (B) A blockchain with a Merkle tree. A Merkle tree is constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves) to create a parent node iteratively, until a single hash, the Merkle Root,1 remains. In this example, the transactions (eg, T12) are first encoded into a binary raw-transaction format and then hashed to create the hashes (eg, Hash of T12). Then, hashes such as the Hash of T12 are paired with other hashes such as the Hash of T11 (if a hash does not have a pair, it simply duplicates itself to be paired) to compute the hash as their parent node (ie, Hash of T11\u201312). The pairing/hashing process repeats until only 1 hash (the Merkle Root) remains, and the Merkle tree construction process is then completed. Finally, by only enclosing the Merkle Root in each block header, the storage space required to verify the integrity/validity of transactions can be reduced.56 That is, if an attacker tries to change the content of any transaction such as T12, all of the related hashes (ie, Hash of T12, Hash of T11\u201312, and Hash of T11\u201314), and eventually the Merkle Root (ie, Hash of T11\u201318) will also change and can be easily verified. To enclose this new Merkle Root to pass the verification process, the attacker then needs to re-create block B1 and all blocks thereafter, which is computationally expensive and is enough to prevent such modification. 2,57 A Merkle tree is the basis of lightweight nodes described in Figure 3 (ie, the blockchain nodes that only need to verify transactions can store parts of the Merkle trees to save space, while the full blockchain nodes that need to \u201cmine\u201d new blocks store all of the Merkle trees).\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/26/5/462/5419321 by guest on 15 O ctober 2022\nDictionary.com60 and Oxforddictionary.com.61 We considered a\nplatform name as a dictionary word only if it could be found in both\nwebsites. The only exception was \u201cBitcoin,\u201d which was included in\nboth dictionaries because it has become famous recently, and in our\nstudy context we still consider it as a nondictionary name. For a\nplatform with a name that is not a dictionary word, we simply used\nthe Google Count of the name (eg, searched \u201cEthereum\u201d directly) as\nthe score of popularity. For a platform with a name that is a dictio-\nnary word, we added an additional keyword \u201cblockchain\u201d while\nsearching (eg, \u201cDash\u201d AND \u201cblockchain\u201d).\nFinally, we ranked the blockchain platforms using these \u201cpopularity\nscores\u201d and manually reviewed the platforms to select 10 popular plat-\nforms being included in our study (see the screening phase in Figure 6).\nThe reason for the manual review instead of just picking the top 10\nranked platforms was to compensate for the limitations of our dictio-\nnary word strategy. For example, although the blockchain platform\nname NXT is not a dictionary word, it is also a division of World Wres-\ntling Entertainment and thus is very popular (ie, high Google Count).\nThe manual review considered these types of exceptions to choose the\nmost well-known and highly popular blockchain platforms.\nData collection process, data items, and synthesis of\nresults For the 10 blockchain platforms (see the included phase in Figure 6),\nwe developed a data sheet to extract the data items (ie, technical fea-\ntures, defined in Table 1), and pilot-tested it on 2 most well-known\nblockchain platforms: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Two authors (T-TK\nand HZR) extracted the data items from included platforms, mainly\nfrom the official published whitepapers and official websites, as well\nas from the other online resources searched using Google.com.\nThese authors then had discussions to resolve the disagreements. If\nan agreement was not reachable, the third author (LO-M) was in-\nvolved in the discussion and made the final decision. After confirm-\ning the data items in the pilot test, we extracted those data items for\neach of the selected 10 blockchain platforms."

Another technique to reduce the need for each user to keep the full history of transactions is to use lightweight nodes together with a Merkle tree. For a user who only wants to use coins but does not want to \u201cmine\u201d new blocks, the full transaction history (more than 150 GB as of January 2018) is too large, especially for smartphones. Therefore, a user can adopt lightweight nodes1 so that only the Merkle Branch1 that links the transactions that the user would like to verify is used. An example of the Merkle Branch for transaction T12 stored on a blockchain lightweight node (eg, on a mobile device), in contrast to the data storage of a full node (eg, on a personal computer), is shown in this figure. With the use of the Merkle tree, a lightweight node only stores data relevant to specific transactions (eg, T12) to save space. 1 For example, in addition to T12 itself, this lightweight node only needs to store related hashes (ie, Hash of T11, Hash of T13\u201314, and Hash of T15\u201318), instead of storing the full Merkle tree, to make sure T12 is linked to block B1. That is, one can first compute the Hash of T12 using T12, and then compute the Hash of T11\u201312 using the Hash of T11 and the Hash of T12. Eventually, one can compute the value of the Merkle Root (Hash of T11\u201318), and compare it with the one stored in B1, to make sure T12 has been verified in B1. This way, a lot of required storage space for those lightweight nodes is saved, making applications such as wallet apps on mobile devices feasible. This verifying process is also known as Simplified Payment Verification.1,59 As a result, users/nodes can be divided into 2 groups: full nodes (the ones storing the whole transaction history and performing mining) and lightweight nodes (ie, the nodes using Simplified Payment Verification just for transactions, without mining), thus reducing the storage space for lightweight nodes and improving the scalability of a blockchain network.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/26/5/462/5419321 by guest on 15 O ctober 2022\nEnemy City\nAttack Attack\nWhen to Attack ?General G1\nGeneral G2\nGeneral G3\nGeneral G4\nGeneral G5\nGeneral G6\nMessengers M1\nMessengers M2\nMessengers M3\nMessengers M4\nMessengers M5\nMessengers M6\n(a)\nWhen to Attack ?\nGeneral G1\n3pm\nTime T0\nGeneral G2\n5pm\nGeneral G3\n1pm\nStart Working\nGeneral G1\nTime T1\nGeneral G2\nGeneral G3\nWork Complete\nGeneral G1\nTime T2\nGeneral G2\nGeneral G3\nB\nAdd to Blockchain\nGeneral G1\nTime T3\nBlockBlock Block\nGeneral G2\nGeneral G3\nB\n1pm\nBlockBlockBlockBlockBlockBlock\nWin and Broadcast\nLost and Agree\nLost and Agree\nMessengers M3\n(b)\nBlock B3Block B2Block B1Block B0\nGeneral G4\nGeneral G3 General G5\n1pm 1pm 1pm\nMessengers M4\nMessengers M3 Messengers M5\nWhen-to-Attack is 1pm, PoW is Completed\nBroadcast to Blockchain\nPoW\nBroadcast\nPrevious Blocks on Blockchain\nBlock B1\nWhen-to-Attack is 7pm, PoW is Completed\nBroadcast to Blockchain\n7pm\n(c)\nGeneral G6\nMessengers M6\nPoW\nBroadcast\nFigure 5. The Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem refers to a distributed set of generals who need to reach a consensus/agreement on the timing of a simultaneous attack by multiple divisions of an army. (A) A simplified example64 of the relaxed version of the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem, showing the difficulty generals have in agreeing on the proper time for an attack. There are several divisions of a Byzantine army camping outside an enemy city, and each division has its own commanding general who would like to, with other generals, reach consensus on the time to attack the city. That is, each general could make a decision about when to attack the city, but to be successful the majority of generals have to come up with an agreement about the attack time. However, the generals can only communicate with each other via messengers, and such communication form is nonsynchronized (eg, if 2 generals announce 2 different preferred times within a very close time frame, some generals may receive one time and other generals may receive another time). In this scenario, it is very difficult for the majority of generals to find a consensus time and execute a successful attack. (B) A Proof-of-Work (PoW) solution to the relaxed version of the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem. To deal with Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem, many blockchain platforms have created consensus protocols to resolve disagreements within the chain. For example, PoW, the consensus protocol of the Bitcoin Blockchain, can find a solution to the relaxed version of the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem, as described by the author Satoshi Nakamoto62 and proved by Miller and LaViola.65 The idea is for each general to first decide an attacking time (eg, at T0 in this example) and start to do PoW (eg, at T1 to find a solution to a difficult-to-compute yet easy-to-verify problem 2,66). Once the PoW is completed (eg, general G3 finds the solution at T2), the winning general (G3) asks the messengers (M3) to broadcast the block containing G3\u2019s proposed attack time T (1 PM in this example) to the blockchain. Since the verification of PoW is relatively simple (ie, fast), other generals can verify the PoW easily. They pause their work because they would only be allowed to add their time after the one proposed by G3. After confirming the PoW is valid, every other general agrees with G3 that the attack will be at 1 PM. (C) The process to reach consensus among generals. After the first block (B1) with the time 1 PM is added to the blockchain, all generals restart PoW based on the hash of B1 to find the second block (B2). One important protocol is that all generals will do PoW based on the longest chain, which ensures the consensus. That is, suppose general G4 also completed the PoW to propose another attack time (7 PM) in block B1\u2019: since another general (G5) has already created a block B2 to support 1 PM, the next general (G6) will only work on the longest chain to support 1 PM instead of 7 PM, thus the consensus attack time would eventually be 1 PM. Finally, after the blockchain is long enough, every general will be confident that the consensus attack time (1 PM) has been agreed by the majority of generals. This is because many generals have been working on the longest chain, thus the probability of a successful consensus of attack time is now high enough to solve the distributed agreement problem.64\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/26/5/462/5419321 by guest on 15 O ctober 2022\nand Mastek.67 We collected the 54 blockchain platform names men-\ntioned in these 4 webpages into the candidate list.

This level of privacy or anonymity is\nalso highly desirable in healthcare applications. Also, Zcash addresses the mining centralization issue (Supplementary Appendix S3).75,76\nHowever, as many health-related applications may be run on\npermissioned networks, platforms like Zcash that use PoW are less at-\ntractive than others that use different protocols."

Important items to consider when selecting a blockchain platform\nFeature Main Options and Implications\nNetwork Permission \u2022 Permission-less network: A public blockchain network configuration designed to allow public participation (eg, some applications that rely on patient-managed data).92\n\u2022 Permissioned network: A private blockchain network configuration that includes only authorized participants (eg, networks that exchange information among hospitals).31,43\nConsensus Protocol \u2022 Proof of Work: A compute-intensive protocol with proof of security; suitable for permission-less blockchain networks but can also be used in permissioned blockchain networks to increase security. The Bitcoin block-\nchain uses this protocol: unfortunately, many people mistakenly believe that all blockchain networks need to use this typically high-energy consumption protocol, which is not true.1,66\n\u2022 Proof of Stake: A low-energy consumption protocol that is suitable for healthcare applications operating on permission-less or permissioned blockchain networks.93\u201395 \u2022 Mining Diversity: A round-robin, low-energy consumption protocol specifically designed for permissioned healthcare applications.31 Variations can be designed to suit various needs. \u2022 Kafka: A voting-based, low-energy consumption protocol that can finalize the consensus decision faster (at least initially), but that requires more time as the number of nodes in the network grows.43 \u2022 Proof of Elapsed Time: A lottery-based, low-energy consumption protocol that can scale well for a network with many nodes while needing more time to reach consensus.43\nSpecial Hardware Requirement \u2022 Yes: If special hardware (eg, Intel SGX43) is required, the specifications of the computing environment need to be confirmed before the healthcare applications can be deployed properly.\n\u2022 No: If no special hardware is required, the healthcare application can be deployed without further hardware checking.\nSmart Contracts Support \u2022 Yes: If the healthcare applications focus on autonomous operations (eg, automatic payment for insurance claims), the immutable smart contract support can be essential.25,43\n\u2022 No: If the healthcare applications aim at primarily serving as a ledger (eg, recording access rights or data transaction records), the blockchain platform without smart contract support would be sufficient.91\nScripting Language \u2022 Bitcoin Script: If smart contracts are not required for the healthcare applications, this basic scripting language would be sufficient.82,96\n\u2022 Solidity: The main smart contract language for Ethereum; it is one of the most popular languages for writing smart contracts.97 \u2022 Chaincode: The main smart contract language for Hyperledger Fabric; it is also one of the most popular languages for writing smart contracts.98\nSoftware License \u2022 MIT: A \u201cpermissive\u201d license that allows healthcare applications to reuse the source code of the platform.99,100\n\u2022 GPL: A \u201ccopyleft\u201d license that also allows using the source code; the derivative works in some situations must be open-source too.99,100\nTable 4.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Summary of findings All 10 popular blockchain platforms are open source, which is a key\nfactor to foster their popularity. Also, 8 of 10 platforms support\ncryptocurrencies, which may become important depending on how\nsystems of incentives are designed for different application. As sev-\neral blockchain platforms were based on Bitcoin Blockchain (eg,\nforked from it or work on top of it), these platforms share similar\nfeatures, such as adopting the PoW consensus protocol, requiring no\nspecial hardware to create new blocks, and being implemented in C\u00fe\u00fe. Finally, Zcash, Dash, and Monero focus on privacy or anonymity of transaction information, which is important for users like\npatients.\nAmong the healthcare and clinical applications that we are\naware of, some are proposed and others are implemented using the\nblockchain platforms included in this review, especially Ethereum,\nHyperledger, and MultiChain. As more applications of blockchain\nemerge, it will also be important that they adhere to standards that\nthe health informatics community has been supporting for a long\ntime. Thus, it is important that the current somewhat disjoint com-\nmunities of blockchain technologists and health informaticists con-\nverge toward more overlap and collaboration to facilitate\nstandardization of technologies from both sides.\nLimitations A limitation of this study is that the blockchain technology is rela-\ntively new and still emerging, so documentation is somewhat very\nlimited (eg, out of date or not available because of the fast and con-\ntinuing development process), and the applications for healthcare or\nmedicine are mostly in early stages (ie, most are proposed systems\nthat have yet to be implemented). Therefore, our systematic compar-\nison is restricted by the data and information we could gather from\npublicly available resources for each platform. Additionally, we fo-\ncused on the most popular platforms, and therefore we only\nreviewed the first 30 webpages returned from the initial Google.com search (ie, blockchain platforms). After deduplication, we selected\n10 of 35 platforms. This selection process may have introduced bias,\nbecause we used not only a popularity ranking, but also a manual\nscreening process. Finally, we extracted 21 data items in 4 categories\n(ie, basic information, blockchain technology, public cryptocur-\nrency, and application programming), which may cover only the\nmost critical aspects in the selection of the blockchain platforms for\nhealthcare applications, while several other minor technical features\nare yet to be included. Finally, we have not run real controlled cases\nto verify that the stated speed of transactions is similar to the one\nstated in the websites."

            "heading": "CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this study, we identified healthcare applications of blockchain, as\nwell as the platforms that have been proposed or implemented by\nthe state-of-the-art healthcare blockchain studies. To understand\nwhich blockchain platform may be more feasible for healthcare or\nclinical applications, we conducted a systematic comparison of 21\ncharacteristics for 10 popular blockchain platforms, to support\nhealth informatics researchers in the selection of the most suitable\nplatform for their specific application. We discussed critical block-\nchain implementation features, introduced these platforms, and\ncompared the technical features that are most relevant to healthcare.\nOur results show that most platforms share similar features, but\nthey are also specialized in different technical characteristics, such as\nimproving transaction speed, mitigating block mining centralization,\nenhancing user privacy or anonymity, and supporting permissioned\nor private blockchain networks. Based on our findings, which indi-\ncate that most healthcare or biomedical research applications are\nstill in early stages of conceptualization, we believe that the use of\nblockchain technology in the healthcare or medicine domains will\nrequire a type of social transformation that constitutes a much big-\nger challenge than the technological one. The ability to think differ-\nently and the willingness to change the way our field operates for\ndecades will require vision, entrepreneurship, and a modest initial\ninvestment that is likely to pay off in a few years. The inherent vir-\ntues of blockchain (decentralization and immutability of the ledger)\npresuppose scenarios in which a minimum number of users agree to\nuse and some agree to actively contribute \u201cblocks\u201d and perform\nother functions (eg, predictive modeling) for healthcare or biomedi-\ncal applications. The transformation will certainly happen if the\nproper system of incentives can be put together.\nThe future directions of this comparative review include moni-\ntoring the progress of healthcare applications, comparing the evolu-\ntion of a larger number of blockchain platforms (through review\nand empirically), and providing targeted suggestions for application-\nspecific platform selection in an expanded spectrum of biomedical\ninformatics projects."
