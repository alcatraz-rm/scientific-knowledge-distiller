In the following year, the open-source Bitcoin implementation was released.2 As a peer-topeer digital currency without a central administrator, Bitcoin is categorized as a decentralized virtual currency by the US Treasury.3 Bitcoin has the unofficial ISO-4217 currency code XBT, which is used by organizations and companies such as Bloomberg4 and XE.5 The unit of Bitcoin is BTC, and 1 BTC is equivalent to about 1200 US dollars as of April 2017.6 Currently, Bitcoin has the highest total market value (19 billion US dollars or 16 million BTC, as of April 2017) among >100 various crypto-currencies currently being used.7\nBitcoins (BTCs) can now be used online at electronic commerce websites to purchase a wide range of commodities and services (see Supplementary Appendix Section A.1 for more details).8\u201311\nKnown challenges for crypto-currencies:\ndouble-spending and single-point-of-failure The underlying distributed ledger technology of Bitcoin is also indi-\ncated as the Bitcoin blockchain, to distinguish it from other block-\nchain technologies. The original motivation of the Bitcoin blockchain\ntechnology was to solve the peer-to-peer double-spending problem (Figure 1)1: How can we prevent electronic coins (defined as \u201ca chain of digital signatures\u201d1) such as bitcoins from being spent twice with-\nout having a central intermediary (eg, bank or mint)?\nIt should be noted that the central intermediary is not desired because it creates a single-point-of-failure, as shown in Figure 2A.12\nThat is, if the central intermediary is down for any reason, including\nscheduled maintenance, the entire network system stops.

The Bitcoin blockchain exploits hash-chain14 as a distrib-\nuted timestamp mechanism, and every node maintains a copy of the\nchain to store every transaction (Figure 3).\nAdditionally, the \u201cmining\u201d process (ie, creating a block with\nenclosed transactions) should be relatively difficult to do, but relatively easy to check.15 The process should be difficult (ie, time-\nconsuming and costly) in order to make attempts to create invalid\nblocks prohibitively expensive (at the cost of increasing the time\navailable to create valid blocks). To implement such a design, Bitcoin blockchain adopts a proof-of-work protocol1 that each block\ncreator has to follow. Figure 4 illustrates how a chain of blocks is created with this protocol.16,17\nAn additional benefit of the proof-of-work consensus protocol\nused in blockchain is the ability to resolve disagreement of the chains, and thus let blockchains be immutable audit trails.1,15 That\nis, when an attacker modifies a block, all the blocks after that block\nare recomputed, because each block contains the hash value of the previous block\u2019s header,16 and the computational cost of such modi-\nfication should be high enough to prohibit attacks (Figure 4).\nOn the other hand, when an attacker creates a malicious chain\nto compete with an honest chain and tries to replace the honest one,\nthe proof-of-work majority voting mechanism can also significantly\nreduce the probability of such an attack to succeed (Figure 5).\nDetailed analyses of the attack-resisting ability of the blockchain\nproof-of-work consensus protocol are proposed in several recent studies.1,18\u201322 The Bitcoin mechanism also provides rewards to the\nnodes, as an incentive to compensate the high cost associated with\n\u201cmining\u201d a new block and verifying transactions (see Supplemen-\ntary Appendix Section A.2 for more details)."

            "heading": "ALTERNATIVE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES AND BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS BEYOND THE FINANCIAL DOMAIN",
            "text": "Alternative crypto-currencies and blockchains After Bitcoin, many other crypto-currencies, such as Ethereum (4 billion USD market cap),23\u201325 Ripple (1 billion USD market cap),26,27 Dash (534 million USD market cap),28,29 Litecoin (512 million USD market cap),30,31 and Monero (311 million USD market cap) were developed.32,33 (These market caps are as of April 2017.7) Addition-\nally, several alternative blockchains (or \u201caltchains\u201d) have been proposed (such as Colored Coins34,35 and Sidechains36) and are considered to be blockchain 1.0 technologies.37 Several alternative\nprotocols to the proof-of-work (see the example shown in Figure 4)\nA B C\nFigure 2. Comparison of the distributed network topologies. (A) Centralized network topology, which creates a single-point-of-failure (the central intermediary). If the central intermediary is down or attacked, the entire network stops working. (B) Decentralized network topology, which does not contain single-point-of-failure. If one of the nodes, such as Node 1, is down or attacked, the rest of the network can still operate normally. (C) Blockchain. If \u201ceveryone can see everything\u201d and there exists a distributed timestamp mechanism, the double-spending problem can be solved on such a decentralized network. In the example illustrated in Figure 1, if everyone (ie, Alice, Bob, Charlie, and all other people in the same network) knows that Alice (Node 1 in this example) sent 10 coins to Charlie yesterday, the transaction to send the same 10 coins to Bob today can thus be rejected through a verification process without consulting a bank.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/24/6/1211/4108087 by guest on 15 O ctober 2022\nhave also been proposed, such as proof-of-stake, where the node with oldest coins can create a new block38\u201340; proof-of-burn, where the\nnode willing to \u201cburn\u201d or destroy the largest number of coins, by sending it to a \u201cNULL\u201d address, can create a new block41,42; and proof-of-\nelapsed-time, where the node with the shortest wait time verified by the trusted execution environment can create a new block.43,44\nBlockchains as distributed ledgers Although blockchain was originally designed as a crypto-currency,\nit is also regarded as a new form of the distributed database or\nledger, as arbitrary data can be stored in the metadata of the transactions. Bitcoin blockchain supports metadata since 2014.45\u201348 The\noriginal Bitcoin blockchain only supports 80 bytes of metadata, but\nother blockchain implementations support larger sizes. For example, MultiChain46,49 supports metadata with adjustable size, and BigchainDB45,50 has no hard limit on metadata size.\nA blockchain-based distributed ledger is also known as blockchain 2.0,37 including the new technologies of \u201csmart properties\u201d and \u201csmart contracts.\u201d23,24,34,36,37,51\u201356 The former refers to the\ndigital properties with ownership controlled by blockchain, and the\nlatter refers to the computer programs designed to manage smart\nproperties. One of the most well-known smart property/contract systems is Ethereum,23\u201325 which is a decentralized platform for smart contracts.23,24 Ethereum as a crypto-currency itself also has the second-largest market cap as of April 2017.7 Microsoft adopted\nEthereum as the core of its new Blockchain-as-a-Service on the Azure cloud computing environment.57 Additional distributed ledger block-\nchains are described in Supplementary Appendix Section A.3.\nNonfinancial applications for the original and\nalternative blockchain technologies Recently, the idea of blockchain 3.0 has been proposed to denote nonfinancial applications of the distributed ledger technology.37 For\nexample, Namecoin applies Bitcoin technology to Domain Name Server and identity management.58,59 Another example is to apply\nblockchain in the scientific research cycle (eg, funding, experiment,\nanalysis, publication, etc.), as blockchain is decentralized, distributed, immutable, and transparent.60 These applications are imple-\nmented either as permission-less (ie, any user can participate) or\npermissioned (ie, only authorized institutions or researchers can par-\nticipate) blockchain networks.\nFigure 4. An example of the nonce mechanism for the proof-of-work protocol. Each block contains an additional \u201cnonce\u201d (32-bit or 8-hex-digits in this example), which is a counter that serves as one of the inputs of the hashing function. To \u201cproof\u201d the hashing work, the nonce is incremented by one bit each time for the hash computation (ie, the \u201cwork\u201d), until the hashed value (256-bit or 64-hex-digits in this example) contains a predefined number of leading zero bits (ie, \u201cproof\u201d of the work, 16-bit or 4-hex-digits in this example). Meanwhile, the newly generated unconfirmed transactions are collected in a memory pool on each node. The first node that successfully completes the proof-of-work (Node 1 at 10:14:30 in this example) has the privilege to create a new block (B2 in this example), verify the transactions, move the confirmed transactions from the memory pool to a newly created block, and add the block to the end of the longest chain (if there are competing chains). It also gets paid (eg, 12.5 bitcoins) for this work. Also, the remaining nodes (Nodes 2 and 3 in this example) stop the proof-of-work mining for B2 when Node 1 completes the proof-of-work. This way, the mining process becomes difficult (ie, one needs to compute the difficult hashing problem by trying different \u201cnonce\u201d values), while the checking process remains easy (ie, just one hash to see if the predefined leading bits are all zeroes). In our example, Alice cannot easily create an invalid block for her double-spend transaction, while Bob and Charlie can easily check that the block Alice created is invalid. It should be noted that the system clocks on the nodes may not be synchronized, therefore we use a global time for demonstration purposes in this example. Also note that, if an attacker modifies any of the transactions in block B1, the value of \u201chash of block B1\u2019s header\u201d and thus block B2 need to be recalculated, and consequently all blocks after B1 (ie, B2 B3, B4, B5,. . .) also need to be recomputed. Therefore, the computational cost of attacking becomes prohibitively high.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/24/6/1211/4108087 by guest on 15 O ctober 2022\nAlthough blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin blockchain are\nwidely recognized and have been used for several purposes, in health\ncare they became known as a means to pay ransom for institutions\nthat had their data \u201ckidnapped\u201d (ie, encrypted by malicious users who request payment to unencrypt the data).61,62 Ransomware has\naffected several health care systems, resulting in thousands of dollars\nin known ransom payments so far. Bitcoin currency is used because\nit is reliable, while it is very difficult to track its recipient. The tech-\nnology behind Bitcoin, however, can be used to help instead of harm\nhealth systems and biomedical research.\nKEY BENEFITS OF BLOCKCHAIN WHEN COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTED DATABASES FOR BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH CARE APPLICATIONS\nTo better understand why blockchain distributed ledger technology\nmay be feasible for biomedical and health care applications, we de-\nscribe the key benefits or comparative advantages of blockchain45,46,63\u201365 by comparing it with the traditional distributed database management system (DDBMS),66,67 such as Structured Query Language (SQL)-based systems like Oracle68 and NoSQLbased systems like Apache Cassandra.69\nThe first key benefit of blockchain is decentralized management.\nDDBMSs are logically centralized-managed (ie, users logically feel\nthey are operating a centralized database, but the underlying\nmachines can be physically distributed), while blockchain is a peer-\nto-peer, decentralized database management system (ie, each node runs independently while following the protocols).45,63,64 Therefore,\nblockchain is suitable for applications where independently man-\naged biomedical/health care stakeholders (eg, hospitals, providers,\npatients, and payers) wish to collaborate with one another without ceding control to a central management intermediary.13,45,65\nThe second key benefit is the immutable audit trail. DDBMSs\nsupport create, read, update, and delete functions like all database\nsystems, while blockchain only supports create and read functions\n(ie, it is very difficult to change the data or records).45 Thus, block-\nchain is suitable as an unchangeable ledger to record critical infor-\nmation (eg, insurance claim records).\nThe third is data provenance. On DDBMS, the ownership of\ndigital assets can be modified by the system administrator, while on\nblockchain, the ownership can only be changed by the owner, following the cryptographic protocols.45 Also, the origins of the assets\nare traceable (ie, the sources or the data and records can be confirmed),45 increasing the reusability of verified data (eg, for insurance transactions).70 Therefore, blockchain is suitable for use in\nmanaging critical digital assets (eg, patient consent records).\nThe fourth benefit is both robustness and availability. Although\nDDBMS and blockchain are based on distributed technology and thus\ndo not suffer from single-point-of-failure, it would be costly for DDBMS\nto achieve the high level of data redundancy blockchain does (ie, each node has a whole copy of whole historical data records).64 Thus, block-\nchain is suitable when the preservation and continuous availability of\nrecords (eg, the electronic health records of patients) are important.\nThe final key benefit of blockchain is related to the improved security and privacy using cryptographic algorithms. For example,\nBitcoin blockchain utilizes the 256-bit Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-\n256), a cryptographic hash function defined in the US Federal Infor-\nmation Processing Standards 186-4, published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology,71 as the cryptographic hash\nfunction in the hash-chain that the proof-of-work algorithm runs on.72 SHA-256 is also used to generate user addresses for privacy/ano-\nnymity improvement (ie, each user is represented by a hash value instead of a real identity, such as an IP address).72 Furthermore, Bitcoin\nblockchain exploits the 256-bit Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algo-\nrithm, an asymmetric cryptography algorithm defined in the US Federal Information Processing Standards 180-4,73 to generate and verify\nhigh-security-level public and private keys as digital signatures, and thus ensures ownership of the digital assets, as with patient records.74\nTo summarize, the key benefits for adopting blockchain technol-\nogy in biomedical and health care applications include: (1) decen-\ntralized management, (2) immutable audit trail, (3) data\nprovenance, (4) robustness/availability, and (5) security/privacy.\nFigure 5. An example of how Bitcoin blockchain deals with branching chains. In this scenario, attackers create malicious blocks (M1 and M2) to compete with an honest block (H2), in an attempt to take over the honest chain (H1 and all blocks before). Assuming the computational power of honest nodes is larger than that of malicious nodes, an honest block H3 is created right after H2, before the attackers create new malicious blocks after M1 and M2. Based on the blockchain mechanism, each node first identifies a valid block based on the length of the chain, and creates a new block (N) only at the end of the longest chain (H1!H2!H3 in this example) while ignoring shorter chains (H1!M1 and H1!M2 in this example). In other words, the blockchain that has been worked on most wins the competition (ie, majority voting of \u201cone CPU, one vote,\u201d[1] since the longest blockchain represents the majority decision of block creators). Given that the mining process is expensive and the honest nodes have higher computational power (ie, have more CPU \u201cvoters\u201d) than the malicious nodes, the probability for the attacker to successfully modify a block and all blocks thereafter (ie, create a malicious competing chain) is very small.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/24/6/1211/4108087 by guest on 15 O ctober 2022"

The applications beyond HIE are depicted in the Advanced\nbiomedical/health care data ledger section.

Even if the network is infiltrated by a malicious party, there is no practical way to read patient data.\u201d85\nDecentralized Management Real-time claim processing: \u201cThe ability to remove intermediaries from a process is the capability that\nsets Blockchain apart from other technologies. This capability will allow the solution to facilitate realtime claims adjudication by replacing the health plan intermediation with transparent Blockchain technologies.\u201d94\nImmutable Audit Trail Improved claim auditing and fraud detection: \u201cPayer, private and government insurers, and individual\npayers have the benefits of] audits facilitation and better fraud detection [based on Blockchain immutability].\u201d92\nData Provenance Verifiable records for claim qualification: \u201c[The chief obstacle of the claim qualification process] is the\ndistributed nature of the many records that feed the decisions of patients, providers, and Medicaid administrators. . .

Real-time access to data would improve clinical care coordination and improve clinical care in emergency medical situations. Real-time data would also allow researchers and public health resources to rapidly detect, isolate and drive change for environmental conditions that impact public health. For example, epidemics could be detected earlier and contained.\u201d86\nSecurity/Privacy Secured and privacy-preserving health care data sharing: \u201cUtilization of the. . . health blockchain. . . has\nthe potential to engage millions of individuals, health care providers, health care entities and medical researchers to share vast amounts of genetic, diet, lifestyle, environmental and health data with guaranteed security and privacy protection.\u201d86\nDecentralized Management Decentralized health data backbone: \u201cThe blockchain then becomes the backbone for digital health,\nincorporating data from patient-based technologies and the EMR to provide a. . . pool from which authorized users, such as providers and patients, has access. All of the data is stored in a decentralized manner, with no single entity storing or having singular authority to access.\u201d101\nImmutable Audit Trail Unchangeable log of clinical research protocols: \u201cUse of blockchain technology has recently been shown\nto provide an immutable ledger of every step in a clinical research protocol, and this could easily be adapted to basic and experimental model science. All participants in the peer-to-peer research network have access to all of the time stamped, continuously updated data. It is essentially tamper proof since any change, such as to the prespecified data analysis, would have to be made in every computer (typically thousands) within the distributed network.\u201d104\nData Provenance Ensure original manufacturer and ownership transferring in pharmaceutical supply chain: \u201cUsing Block-\nchain, the origin of the [medicine] product and its components are detected, and any transfer of ownership in each case is made clear and available to everyone. Forged, poor quality or stolen goods can be tracked and identified.\u201d76,105\nRobustness/Availability Improved robustness for counterfeit drug prevention/detection systems in pharmaceutical supply chain:\n\u201cIn the existing solutions, there is still a central authority that can be compromised and documents that can be faked. . . If [the current solutions] can be modified with blockchain-enabled anti-tampering capabilities during manufacturing, the supply and dispensation system could make drug counterfeiting a non-issue.\u201d92\nSecurity/Privacy Higher patient confidence in consent recording systems: \u201cPatients are able to add consent statements at\nany point in their care journey \u2013 confident that the blockchain will hold them securely.\u201d89\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/24/6/1211/4108087 by guest on 15 O ctober 2022\nThe first challenge is related to transparency and confidentiality. As \u201ceveryone can see everything\u201d on a blockchain network,46,110,109\nheightened transparency and decreased confidentiality, such as open\ntransparency of information during transfer, is usually considered a\nlimitation of blockchain. Also, even if a user is \u201canonymized\u201d by\nusing hash values as addresses, the user may still be reidentified\nthrough inspection and analysis of the publicly available transaction\ninformation on the blockchain network, and therefore the blockchain network only provides \u201cpseudonymity.\u201d110\u2013113 This issue is\ncritical for biomedical/health care applications, because patient-\nrelated data (protected health information, or PHI, and personal\nidentifiable information) are highly sensitive.\nThe second challenge is related to speed and scalability. The\ntransaction time of blockchain can be long, depending on the proto-\ncol, and such a speed constraint may limit the scalability of\nblockchain-based applications. For example, with the proof-of-\nwork protocol, there are about 288 000 transactions per day (or\nabout 3.3 transactions per second) on average for Bitcoin due to the\nrequired computation workload, while there are 150 million trans-\nactions per day (or about 2000 transactions per second) on average for a credit card like Visa.114,115 The theoretical maximum transac-\ntion speed for Bitcoin is 7 transactions per second due to the 1 mega-\nbyte block size limitation in the current protocol, while the\ntheoretical maximum number of transactions is 4000 per second for Visa.114,115 This issue is important when constructing real-time and scalable blockchain-based health care/biomedical applications.89\nThe last challenge is the threat of a 51% attack. A blockchain network may suffer from the \u201c51% attack,\u201d23,46,116 which happens\nwhen there are fewer honest nodes than malicious ones in the whole\nnetwork, and thus the whole network is taken over by the malicious\nattackers (Figure 6). This issue is also critical for security-\ndemanding health care/biomedical applications.\nProposed solutions and implementations The above challenges can be mitigated by careful design and imple-\nmentation of the biomedical/health care application systems. We take ModelChain13 as an example. ModelChain adopts blockchain to se-\ncurely and robustly disseminate privacy-preserving predictive models\n(ie, a set of machine learning parameters or aggregated values) be-\ntween health care institutions. Because it only disseminates predictive\nmodels but not PHI, transparency is not a critical issue. Also, it con-\ntains a machine learning process that can take a long time to run\n(minutes, or even hours), thus the transaction speed of blockchain\nbecomes relatively negligible. Finally, since it adopts permissioned\nblockchain networks, malicious nodes could not arbitrarily participate\nin the network, and therefore the risk of a 51% attack is minimal.\nOther implementation techniques to mitigate the transparency/ confidentiality issue include encrypting sensitive data (eg, PHI or\npersonal identifiable information) on the blockchain network,87,97,118 storing sensitive data off-blockchain and only dissemi-\nnating \u201cpointers\u201d (eg, encrypted links) or permission information on-blockchain,88,96,97,117 and automating data management protocols using smart contracts.96\u201398\nTo deal with the speed/scalability issue, plausible solutions in-\nclude exploiting blockchain as an index of health data instead of the repository of all records,86 and storing only ongoing verified transactions rather than the complete history on blockchain.92 Also, several new blockchain implementations, such as BigchainDB,45,50 provide\nsignificantly higher transaction speed than the Bitcoin blockchain, which could also solve the speed and scalability problem.18,119\nThe threat of a 51% attack on the biomedical/health care block-\nchain network can be drastically reduced by using a virtual private\nnetwork to disseminate the data and deploying some components of\nthe system on private Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct\u2013compliant cloud computing environments such as iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and Sharing).120,121"

An example of 51% attack. In this scenario, attackers create malicious blocks (M1 and M2) to compete with an honest block (H2), trying to take over the honest chain (H1 and all blocks before). However, this time the computational power of host nodes is smaller than that of malicious nodes (ie, malicious nodes control more than 51% of the computing power on the network), thus a malicious block M3 is created right after M2. Based on the blockchain mechanism, the new block (N) will be created only at the end of the longest chain (H1!M2!M3 in this example). Therefore, the attacker has successfully modified the blockchain record (from H2 to M2) and takes over the chain by winning the majority vote.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/24/6/1211/4108087 by guest on 15 O ctober 2022\ntechnology (ie, improved medical record management, enhanced insur-\nance claim process, accelerated clinical/biomedical research, and\nadvanced biomedical/health care data ledger).
