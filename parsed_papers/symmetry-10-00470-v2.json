    "abstractText": "Blockchain technology enables a decentralized and distributed environment with no need for a central authority. Transactions are simultaneously secure and trustworthy due to the use of cryptographic principles. In recent years, blockchain technology has become very trendy and penetrated different domains, mostly due to the popularity of cryptocurrencies. One field where blockchain technology has tremendous potential is healthcare, due to the need for a more patient-centric approach to healthcare systems and to connect disparate systems and increase the accuracy of electronic healthcare records (EHRs). In this systematic review, an analysis of state-of-the-art blockchain research in the field of healthcare is conducted. The aim is to reveal the potential applications of the technology and to highlight the challenges and possible directions of blockchain research in healthcare. First, background information is discussed, followed by a description of the exact methodology used in this paper. Next, an analysis of the results is given, which includes a bibliometric overview, an analysis of gathered data and its properties, and the results of a literature quality assessment. Lastly, there is a discussion of the results from the analysis. The findings indicate that blockchain technology research in healthcare is increasing and it is mostly used for data sharing, managing health records and access control. Other scenarios are very rare. Most research is aimed at presenting novel structural designs in the form of frameworks, architectures or models. Findings also show that technical details about the used blockchain elements are not given in most of the analyzed publications and that most research does not present any prototype implementation or implementation details. Often even with a prototype implementation, no details about blockchain elements are given.",

            "text": "Blockchain technology has been penetrating every aspect of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and its use has been growing rapidly in recent years. The interest and development of this technology has primarily been driven by the enormous value growth of cryptocurrencies and large investments of venture capital in blockchain start-ups. It is forecast that the market for blockchain technology will grow until 2021 [1]. Currently there are more than 1500 crypto coins [2], which were created in just a few years after the introduction of Bitcoin [3]. Bitcoin was the pioneer digital coin. It assures that transactions are performed in a decentralized way without the need for a trusted central authority. As public keys are employed there is no need to disclose someone\u2019s identity. A vital part of the Bitcoin network are miners that receive coins for their computational work to verify and store transactions (payments) in the Bitcoin blockchain. The interested reader can find more information about Bitcoin in [4\u20136]. Cryptocurrencies are just one example of the use of blockchain technology. Basically there are three concepts that need to be distinguished in a cryptocurrency [4]\u2014the blockchain, the protocol and\nSymmetry 2018, 10, 470; doi:10.3390/sym10100470 www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nthe currency. A coin can implement its own currency and protocol, but use the blockchain of another coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum [7]. In the world of cryptocurrencies, the blockchain acts as a distributed ledger that stores all the performed transactions of coins. Con-sequentially, such a blockchain grows continuously as new blocks are added over time. Most known cryptocurrency blockchains are public and one can query their transactions through web platforms like blockchain.com\u2014a web platform for querying the transactions of the Bitcoin blockchain. Blockchain enables transactions between entities without the need for a (trusted) third-party. It relies on validators (often miners) that replace the third parties and validate transactions in a decentralized way. This is achieved through a distributed consensus\u2014an ability to agree on something among multiple parties that do not trust each other. In the crypto-currency world, this computational problem is related to the double-spending problem, i.e., how to confirm that a specific amount of a digital coin has not already been spent without the validation of a trusted third-party (usually a bank), which keeps a record of all transactions and users\u2019 balances. Surveys on the application of blockchain in different fields have already been published [8]. Zheng et al. [9\u201311] provide a review on the architecture and the different mechanisms involved in blockchain technology. Additionally, Karafiloski and Mishev [12], and Ahram et al. [13] provided overviews on blockchain technology with an emphasis on its application in big data and industrial applications. Conoscenti et al. [14] and Yli-Huumo et al. [15] published systematic reviews that analyze the application areas of blockchain and related research topics. There are papers that address the applicability of blockchain technology in the healthcare domain [16\u201325], but none of those took a systematic approach to review the target field.\nMotivation and Contribution\nIn contrast to the mentioned papers, this work presents a systematic review and analysis of the state-of-the-art blockchain research in the field of healthcare. The aim of this paper is also to indicate the potential usage of blockchain in healthcare and to show the challenges and potential directions of blockchain research. This systematic review only includes research that introduces a new solution, algorithm, method, methodology, or architecture for the field of healthcare. Review type research, discussions of possible uses and applications of blockchain, and other non-relevant publications are excluded. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present background information on blockchain technology and its concepts as well as the need for blockchain in healthcare. The systematic review methodology, research questions, the included databases, selection of studies and the literature quality assessment are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents the data analysis including a bibliometric overview, an analysis of gathered data and its properties, and the literature quality assessment results. Furthermore, a discussion of the results is presented in Section 5 together with the discussion and answers to the research questions. The paper is summed up in Section 6 where conclusions are drawn and future work is discussed."

            "text": "In this section, we discuss the fundamentals of blockchain technology to help understand the rest of this paper. A blockchain can be seen as a distributed ledger that shares data among a network of peers [4,9,26]. It was introduced together with Bitcoin and solved a long-lasting problem\u2014the double-spend problem. In Bitcoin this is achieved through a consensus of the majority of the so-called mining nodes and the appending of valid transactions to the blockchain. The first application of blockchain was in cryptocurrency. However, it is not necessary to introduce a cryptocurrency in order to use blockchain and build decentralized applications [27]. To get the reader to better understand the concept of the blockchain, its basic characteristics and building elements will be described in the next subsections."

            "text": "A blockchain can be defined as a chain of blocks that are time-stamped and linked using cryptographic hashes. These blocks are sealed in a secure and immutable manner [26,28]. The chain is constantly growing and new blocks are being appended to the end, whereby each new block holds a reference (i.e., a hash value) to the content of the previous block [29]. The shareholders, also referred to as nodes of the blockchain are organized in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Each node in the network is in the possession of two keys [30]: a public key that is used for encrypting the messages sent to a node and a private key that is used to decrypt the messages and allows a node to read it. Thus the public key encryption mechanism is used to ensure the consistency, irreversibility and non-repudiability of a blockchain [9]. Only the proper private key can decrypt the messages encrypted with the corresponding public key. This concept is know as asymmetric cryptography. As a detailed explanation is out of the scope of this paper, further details can be found in [30,31]. All the blocks in the blockchain are linked using the so-called hash which is generated using a cryptographic one-way hash function (e.g., SHA256). It also ensures anonymity, immutability and compactness of the block [32]. Each transaction carried out by a node is signed before it is broadcasted to the network for later confirmation. The digital signing of a transaction using the private key enables authentication and provides integrity of a transaction. The first is due to the fact that only a user with a specific private key can sign the transaction and the second is due to the fact that an error during transmission of the data results in the inability of decryption (i.e., verifying a digital signature). Transactions disseminated in the network and considered valid by the network are ordered and packed into time-stamped blocks by specific nodes, which are called miners when the network is using specific consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. How the miners are chosen and what data is included in the block depend on the consensus protocol (a more detailed definition of a consensus protocol is given later). The blocks are then broadcast to the network, where the validation nodes verify that the received block contains valid transactions and that it references the previous block in the chain by using the corresponding hash. If both requirements are fulfilled, the nodes add the block to the blockchain. If the requirements are not fulfilled, the block is discarded. This brings us to the role of network nodes. Since the blockchain network is a P2P network, a node can be regarded as a peer when it starts to connect and communicate with other nodes in the network, thus the appropriate name would be a peer-node. We will henceforth denote it as a \u201cnode\u201d for easier comprehension. In layman\u2019s terms, a full node is any computer that has the core blockchain client installed and operates a full copy of the whole blockchain ledger [9,33,34]. A user wishing to engage with the blockchain connects to the blockchain network through a node [33]. The previously mentioned miners are a subset of nodes, since all miners must also operate a fully functional node. Hence, each miner is a node, but not every node is also a miner. This scenario is known from a specific public blockchain type employing the PoW (proof-of-work) consensus (more on this later in this section). Other types of blockchain networks, using other distributed consensus types, do not require mining, e.g., PoS (proof-of-stake) [15].\nThe basic tasks of a blockchain node are [33,34]:\n\u2022 connecting to the blockchain network, \u2022 storing an up-to-date ledger, \u2022 listening to transactions, \u2022 passing on valid transactions into the network, \u2022 listening for newly sealed blocks, \u2022 validating newly sealed blocks\u2014confirming transactions, \u2022 creating and passing on new blocks."

            "heading": "2.2. Types of Blockchains",
            "text": "Generally, there are different types of blockchains depending on the managed data, on the availability of such data, and on what actions can be performed by the user. These include:\n\u2022 public permissionless, \u2022 consortium (public permissioned), \u2022 private.\nAll the data in the public permissionless (often called just public) blockchain is accessible and visible to the public. However, some parts of the blockchain could be encrypted in order to preserve a participant\u2019s anonymity [9]. In a public permissionless blockchain anyone is able to join the blockchain without any approval and can act as a simple node or as a miner (node). These types of blockchains are usually given an economic incentive, such as in cryptocurrency networks. Examples of such a blockchain include Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin [3,7,35]. The consortium type blockchain enables only a selected group of nodes to participate in the distributed consensus process [9]. It can be used within one or across several industries. When a consortium blockchain is established within one industry (e.g., financial sector), it is opened for limited public use and partially centralized. On the other hand, a consortium between industries (e.g., insurance companies, financial institutions, governmental institutions) is opened for public use while still having established a partially centralized trust. A private blockchain only enables chosen nodes to join the network. It is therefore a distributed yet centralized network [9]. Private blockchains are permissioned networks in order to control which nodes can perform transactions, execute smart contracts or act as miners. They are managed by one organization which is the trusted party. It is used for private purposes. Hyperledger Fabric [36] and Ripple [37] are examples of blockchain platforms that only support private blockchain networks. Note that such classifications are still being debated and different definitions might be found in literature.\nA distinction between blockchains can also be made based on their purpose:\n\u2022 for tracking digital assets (e.g., Bitcoin) and \u2022 for running certain logic (i.e., smart contracts).\nSome blockchains use tokens (e.g., Ripple, Bitcoin, Ethereum), while others do not (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric)."

            "heading": "2.3. Distributed Consensus Protocols",
            "text": "For the blockchain network to remain functional, its peers need to agree on a certain state of the distributed ledger and on a way for packing data into blocks. Such an agreement is called a distributed consensus protocol and it validates the chronological order of generated transactions [9]. It ensures that a quorum of blockchain network peers agree on the precise state of the shared ledger, and thus the order in which new blocks are added to the ledger [26]. Some of the used distributed consensus protocols are [9,26,38]:\n\u2022 proof-of-work (PoW), \u2022 proof-of-stake (PoS), \u2022 delegated-proof-of-stake (DPoS), \u2022 proof-of-importance (PoI), \u2022 proof-of-activity (PoA), \u2022 proof-of-burn (PoB), \u2022 proof-of-deposit (PoD).\nA distributed consensus protocol defines how a network determines which peer will prepare and seal the newest block with still unconfirmed and non-formatted data. The simplest way is to determine it randomly, but such an approach is not effective in terms of network longevity and can even be\ndangerous for the network, since peers could decide to attack the whole network [9]. The idea behind PoW, PoS and others is the fact that the chosen node (miner) contributes something valuable and the best node is rewarded. The reward promotes competition and a competition where adversaries check each others\u2019 work and valuables also mitigates the chances of a possible attack. The PoW consensus protocol is used in the Bitcoin network. It uses computing power as a mechanism to determine the chosen peer [3,9,15]. The competition between peers is based on hashing unconfirmed transactions. Therefore, a peer\u2019s chance of being chosen is in proportion to its computational power. Each time a peer wins and is chosen, it gets a reward. The current reward in Bitcoin network is 12.5 newly generated bitcoins, which are added to the chosen peer\u2019s account [26]. The hashing competition, which is called mining, is based on the calculation of a block, containing unconfirmed transactions, a random nonce and a hash reference to the previous block. It is required that the outcome of the hash is equal to a predefined value. In case a miner reaches the required value, it broadcasts the newly generated block to the network. Other peers then validate it and if correct it is replicated in the network [9]. The PoS consensus protocol is based on the assets a peer possesses (i.e., the stake of the network value a peer has under control). A peer\u2019s chance of being chosen to confirm a new block is in proportion to its assets (i.e., wealth or stake). In practice, this is realized by having a peer deposit a predefined minimum number of its assets. This buys the node a ticket. The winner is chosen in a deterministic pseudo-random way from a group of peers with tickets. The competition in this case is not based on the computational power of the peers, meaning there is minimal energy consumption in comparison to the PoW. However, such an approach is similar to a shareholder corporation, where the rich have an advantage [38]. This works, because it is unlikely a peer will attack the network, since in this case it would attack its own assets [9]. There are multiple versions of the PoS consensus protocol, whereby each introduces a different approach on how to choose the validator in order to ensure fairness. One of these versions is the Distributed PoS (DPoS). The difference between a regular PoS and a DPoS system can be compared to the difference between a direct democracy and a representative democracy, since stakeholders vote in order to decide the signer, i.e., the delegate [9]. Therefore, we can state that nodes determine the distributed consensus, thus agreeing on specific rules and that the blockchain acts as a consensus mechanism to ensure that the nodes stay in sync [34]."

            "heading": "2.4. The Need for Blockchain in Healthcare",
            "text": "One of the fields where blockchain is considered to have great potential is healthcare [39]. To transform healthcare, the focus should be given to the management of data that could benefit from the potential to connect disparate systems and increase the accuracy of EHRs. Blockchain technology can be used to support drug prescriptions and supply chain management, pregnancy and any risk data management as well as to support access control, data sharing and managing of an audit trail of medical activities. Other healthcare areas that can benefit from blockchain technology are provider credentials, medical billing, contracting, medical record exchange, clinical trials, and anti-counterfeiting drugs. Healthcare services are transforming to enable a patient-centric approach. Blockchain-based healthcare systems could enhance security and reliability of patients\u2019 data since patients would have control over their healthcare records. Those systems could also help consolidate patient data, enabling the exchange of medical records across different healthcare institutions. Storing the medical data of patients is very important in healthcare. These data are very sensitive and therefore also a prime target for cyber-attacks. It is important to secure all sensitive data. Another aspect is control over data which would ideally be managed by the patient. Therefore, sharing and accessing the control of patients\u2019 healthcare data is another use case which can benefit from advanced modern technologies. Blockchain technology is very robust against attacks and failures, and provides different methods of access control. Therefore, blockchain provides a good framework for healthcare data.\nFor personal medical data, the most adequate type of a blockchain would be a private blockchain. According to the W\u00fcrst and Gervais decision model, a blockchain can be used in a scenario where multiple parties who do not trust each other need to interact and exchange common data, but would not like to involve a trusted third-party (TTP) [40]. Their model presents several factors which need to be considered when analyzing whether a specific scenario requires blockchain. Regarding storage, there are several factors (questions) that need to be considered [40]:\n\u2022 Is there a need for storing data (with regard to the authors of a specific state)? \u2022 Do you need multiple write access? \u2022 Is a TTP available and can one that is always online be used?\nFirstly, we have to determine the need for data storing (in a typical scenario this is a database). Subsequently, it needs to be determined if there is a need for writing access for multiple parties. If only one writer exists, then no blockchain is needed and alternative solutions can be considered (e.g., a database). It has to be noted that traditional databases offer better performance than a blockchain. If a TTP is available, is always online, and can be fully trusted, then there is no need for blockchain. The W\u00fcrst and Gervais decision model also helps determine what type of blockchain should be used (e.g., public permissionless, public permissioned, or private). If the writers are not known, the only obvious choice would be a public permissionless blockchain. If the TTP is offline, it could function similarly to a certification authority and the involved parties do not mutually trust each other, a permissioned blockchain could be employed. However, if all the parties mutually trust each other, then a database with shared access could be used instead of a blockchain. On the other hand, if writers are known and can be trusted, the choice falls between a public permissioned and private blockchain. The first is in the case where you need public verifiability and the second in the case when it is not needed. Please note that these parts of the model imply that the first three questions stated before are answered positively\u2014otherwise deploying a blockchain is unnecessary. The current medical data infrastructure mostly depends on trusted third parties. In several cases these cannot be fully trusted. The blockchain, which relies on consensus and does not need a central authority, is a possible solution to this problem."

The analyzed publication had to relate closely to the defined research questions. The remaining results also had to include a novel and sufficient contribution to the field of healthcare by the means of a blockchain. Many results were excluded as the introduced idea was very general and no further details on its design or implementation were given.

After collecting the basic information, we were interested in the two primary fields of interest in this paper\u2014blockchain and healthcare. We collected the contributions of the analyzed publications. Typical contributions are a presentation or discussion of a structural design (i.e., a framework or an architecture), an algorithm or a protocol, a consensus algorithm or a new metric.\nWe were also interested for which purpose or field a blockchain included in healthcare was used. As blockchain technology can serve multiple purposes we have allowed for more than one to be selected. We found that a blockchain is usually used in the following fields:\n\u2022 data sharing, \u2022 access control, \u2022 health records (EHRs, EMRs and PHRs), \u2022 managing an audit trail, \u2022 supply chain, \u2022 others.\nMany publications discuss record keeping.

These publications were published in 2016 and 2017 at two conferences and in three journals. The reason for low citation numbers is that most publications were published in the last two years (2017 and 2018). Because they are relatively new there was not enough time to gather citations and we can assume that those publications will get additional citations in the future. All the publications with 0 citation were published in 2017 and 2018 and all the publications with 16 or more citations were published in 2016. Of the final 33 publications, 14 are conference proceeding papers, 11 are journal papers, 3 are patents and 5 papers are grey literature. Regarding the publication type, most publications in 2017 were published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings. This paradigm has shifted in 2018 as most publications were published in peer-reviewed journals. Figure 2 also shows that the overall amount of research has declined in 2018 when compared to the year before. However, please note that the data for 2018 is only for the first half of the year and that the number of published publications has already almost reached the number from 2017 and by far exceeded the number from 2016. Given the current number of publications for 2018 we have no doubt that the number of publications will again exceed the preceding year.

The vast majority of research was published in peer-reviewed journals or in peer-reviewed conference proceedings. The final selection also includes a few patents (which are also reviewed before publication) and grey literature which was included for completeness. Table 3 shows that most of these publications have citations, and the ones that have none are newer (i.e., 2017 and 2018).\nAltogether we have analyzed 33 publications using the methodology mentioned in Section 3.4. Table 4 shows the publications\u2019 contributions. Out of the 33 publications, a new structural design\n(i.e., introducing a framework, an architecture or a model employing a blockchain) occurred 27 (82%) times. Algorithms, protocols or schemes were proposed in 4 (12%) publications. The remaining 2 (6%) publications present two other contributions\u2014a new consensus algorithm and metrics for benchmarking distributed applications based on a blockchain platform. The next analysis that we conducted in our systematic review is the purpose or field of blockchain use in healthcare. As can be seen in Table 5, most publications apply blockchain in healthcare for data sharing, health records and access control. Often, authors state multiple applications of blockchain technology in healthcare (e.g., for data sharing and access control) which could be regarded as expected since the blockchain technology itself implies specific applications\u2014e.g., it is the nature of a distributed\ntechnology like blockchain to be used for data sharing, and it is therefore understandable that this field of research would be often mentioned.\nAfter collecting data on the realization of the ideas described in publications we have discovered that the majority of publications rarely presented a working solution, although this trend has started to turn as we can see in Figure 3. Since 2017 there were five publications that presented a working solution, while there were none in the years before that. Since our search was done in June of 2018, there will probably be more publications with implemented solutions in 2018 and in the future.\nWe planned to collect technical details pertaining to blockchain from the selected publications; however, we have discovered that these are very poorly described. The blockchain elements are typically poorly defined or not defined at all. The absence of details can be attributed to the fact that most publications are highly theoretical and do not include a prototype or a real-life implementation. Nevertheless, we gathered information on blockchain platforms and consensus algorithms where possible. Additionally, we have tried to identify the types of blockchains used and to ascertain if the use of a smart contract was proposed or not. Please note that not all blockchain platforms support smart contracts\u2014for example, the Ethereum platform supports smart contracts, whereas Bitcoin does not. As can be observed from Table 6, the platforms which are most commonly used are Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric while the most common consensus algorithm defined in the publications is the proof-of-work. None of the publications used a public blockchain platform, but rather a public\npermissioned (consortium) or a private type of blockchain. Almost half of the analyzed publications also proposed the use of smart contracts for their solutions."

We proposed three research questions which are discussed here.\nRQ1: To what extent is a blockchain established in healthcare and how did this change over time?\nIn this systematic review, we searched publications published between 2008 and 2019 on blockchain technology used in healthcare. The publications that were identified as suitable for analysis were published after 2015, indicating that the technology is new and just entering the healthcare field. In the review process, we identified 33 publications, out of which only 5 presented an implemented and deployed solution as can been seen in Figure 3. In most publications, proposals are made that could be implemented, but mostly were not. The implemented solutions were published in 2017 and 2018, which indicates that interest in employing blockchain in healthcare is rising. Another indicator of blockchain being used in healthcare through time shows that more publications are published each year on this topic, as presented in Figure 2. Our search was done in June 2018 and therefore only the first half of 2018 is included. In this period, 11 publications were published on the topic of blockchain in healthcare. In the year 2015, only 2 patents were published, while in the year 2016 there were 4 publications. Most publications (16) were published in 2017. The results of this study showed that the use of blockchain in healthcare is increasing and does not show any sign of waning.\nRQ2: What are the current research trends for blockchain use in healthcare?\nThe areas of healthcare addressed in the analyzed publications demonstrate current research trends in this field. The results presented in Table 5, indicate that most of the publications use blockchain technology for the purpose of data sharing, health records and access control. Additionally, blockchain is rarely used for supply chain management, audit trail management and other scenarios, like drug prescription management and auditing. We could argue that blockchain as a decentralized system is therefore reasonably used (as to W\u00fcrst and Gervais decision model [40]) in the analyzed publications in the field of healthcare. However, with regard to the European Coordination Committee\nof the Radiological and Electromedical and Healthcare IT Industry [39] there are still many possibilities for employing blockchain in healthcare, like medical billing or anti-counterfeiting drugs.\nRQ3: What are the elements of blockchain technology used in healthcare publications?\nAn analysis of contributions was conducted and we also looked at blockchain elements that were used or proposed to be used in the publications. Most of the publications presented a structural design such as a framework, an architecture or a model for use in healthcare and employing a blockchain (Table 4). Far fewer publications presented a new algorithm or a protocol. Additionally, one publication presented a new consensus algorithm and one a metric for benchmarking healthcare distributed apps (dApp). When searching for specific blockchain elements that were used or suggested in the research we found that authors very rarely specified them (Table 6). This could either be because the research we have found is highly theoretical or because these are all components that can be switched to better suit one\u2019s needs and the authors did not wish to prescribe a sin-gular solution. Nevertheless, the publications that did specify the blockchain elements have shown Ethereum and Hyper-ledger Fabric to be the most popular blockchain platforms. The 11 publications that defined the blockchain type used a private or a consortium (public permissioned) blockchain. This is expected for healthcare as it is desirable to have control over access and writing to the blockchain and it is not desirable that writing (adding blocks to the blockchain) could be done by anyone. The most commonly used consensus algorithm turned out to be proof-of-work. This was very surprising to us. Healthcare is an environment where the speed of transactions could be very important and PoW is a very slow consensus algorithm. PoW is also generally not used with consortium or private chains where the actors are generally known (in this case, hospitals, patients, insurance companies, etc.) and trust is easier to establish. Consortium or private chains are usually more centralized (e.g., hospitals) than public networks where anybody can be a node and where PoW is the dominant consensus algorithm. Finally, the PoW is also a very computationally demanding algorithm. It would be impractical if hospitals would have to establish large computer centres just to mine the transactions. For all of these reasons we were surprised to see the PoW being used this often. We expected algorithms like proof-of-authority or proof-of-stake to be much more popular, because they fit around all the discussed PoW limitations. We suspect that PoW was so popular in the gathered research, because as we have seen in the previous section the use of blockchain in healthcare is only getting started and the pioneers in the field looked to existing solutions for inspiration. The most common and publicized application of blockchain are the cryptocurencies where PoW is prevalent. Additionally, 15 publications contained (explicitly) the intent of using smart contracts in their proposal. It is unexpected to note that less than half of all proposals did not use an element as useful as a smart contract. Smart contracts enable additional functionalities and new possibilities of blockchain application in healthcare\u2014e.g., we can limit access, automate certain tasks, etc. In summary, the elements of blockchain used in the gathered research is broad, as would be expected. Researchers build networks with some participant restrictions (consortium and private networks), to give the network better control over access and record creation. The two most commonly used platforms in the selected publications are probably the two most popular and well developed platforms\u2014Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, both of which support smart contracts. Smart contracts add a lot of functionality to a blockchain, but researchers do not seem to be using them quite as often as one would think. Therefore, a further use of smart contracts and the introduction of less constraining consensus algorithms would be, in our opinion, the primary area for further research and better integration of blockchain technology into healthcare."

The blockchain technology presents a decentralized network and is regarded as having great potential for use in healthcare, because of the sensitive nature of data being processed and managed. The aim of the study\nwas to identify the current status of blockchain research and application in healthcare. To achieve this objective, we have defined research questions and using the predefined methodology we have narrowed down the analyzed literature to 33 publications. These were then further analyzed. We have searched 9 relevant online databases for publications published between 2008 and 2019. For the in-depth analysis, the set of 33 publications was inspected by three reviewers. We have collected data as prompted by our research questions and assessed the publications using the predefined assessment criteria. Our findings indicate that blockchain technology research and its employment in healthcare is increasing. Current trends of blockchain research in healthcare indicate that it is mostly used for data sharing, health records and access control, but rarely for other scenarios, such as supply chain management or drug prescription management. Therefore, much potential for blockchain is still unexploited. Most re-search presents a novel framework, architecture or model using blockchain technology in healthcare. Additionally, often technical details about the used blockchain elements are not given\u2014e.g., blockchain platform, consensus algorithm, blockchain type or the use of smart contracts. Particularly, smart contracts could be more used as they enable the automation of processes within a blockchain platform. Most research could also provide a prototype implementation or at least discuss some implementation details of their proposals. As for further research, blockchains are still fairly new technology in the field of healthcare and new ways for employing it can still be found and researched. To sum up\u2014blockchain should continue to be used in scenarios where it is reasonable and needed.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors equally contributed to the conception of the idea, the layout of the research plan, the construction of the search queries and participated in the literature search.
