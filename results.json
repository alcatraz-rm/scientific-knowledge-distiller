        "abstract": "Abstract We give a sharp polynomial bound on the number of Pollicott\u2013Ruelle resonances. These resonances, which are complex numbers in the lower half-plane, appear in expansions of correlations for Anosov contact flows. The bounds follow the tradition of upper bounds on the number of scattering resonances and improve a recent bound of Faure and Sj\u00f6strand. The complex scaling method used in scattering theory is replaced by an approach using exponentially weighted spaces introduced by Helffer and Sj\u00f6strand in scattering theory and by Faure and Sj\u00f6strand in the theory of Anosov flows.",

Recently numerical studies linked the phenomenon of resonances chains to an approximate clustering of the length spectrum on integer multiples of a base length. A canonical example of such a scattering system is provided by 3-funneled hyperbolic surfaces where the lengths of the three geodesics around the funnels have rational ratios. In this article we present a mathematical rigorous study of the resonance chains for these systems. We prove the analyticity of the generalized zeta function which provide the central mathematical tool for understanding the resonance chains. Furthermore we prove for a fixed ratio between the fun- nel lengths and in the limit of large lengths that after a suitable rescaling, the resonances in a bounded domain align equidistantly along certain lines. The position of these lines is given by the zeros of an explicit polynomial which only depends on the ratio of the funnel lengths.",

It is known that for any $C>0$, there exists some anisotropic Sobolev space $\\mathcal{H}_{C}$ such that the operator $A=-X+V$ has intrinsic discrete spectrum on $\\mathrm{Re}\\left(z\\right)>-C$ called Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. In this paper, we show that the density of resonances is bounded by $O\\left(\\left\\langle \\omega\\right\\rangle ^{\\frac{n}{1+\\beta_{0}}}\\right)$ where $\\omega=\\mathrm{Im}\\left(z\\right)$, $n=\\mathrm{dim}M-1$ and $0<\\beta_{0}\\leq1$ is the Holder exponent of the distribution $E_{u}\\oplus E_{s}$ (strong stable and unstable). We also obtain some more precise results concerning the wave front set of the resonances states and the group property of the transfer operator. We use some semiclassical analysis based on wave packet transform associated to an adapted metric on $T^{*}M$ and construct some specific anisotropic Sobolev spaces.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by their appearance in the physical sciences, scattering resonances of the three-dimensional  Dirac  operator  perturbed  by  a  real-valued,  smooth,  compactly  supported, electric potential are studied.  The potentials are 4\u00d74 matrix-valued, multiplication operators.  Under a prescribed mapping, the cut-off full resolvent is extended meromorphically from the physical half-plane to the whole complex plane.  The poles that lie in the un-physical plane are defined as resonances for the perturbed Dirac operator.\n\nThis  thesis  presents  basic  properties  of  the  free  and  full  Dirac  resolvents  and introduces  the  resonances  that  the  latter  creates.   Particular  attention  is  paid  to  the resonances appearing at the threshold points when the full resolvent is studied near these limits.\n\nThe scattering matrix is analysed as a mapping between solutions of the Dirac eigenvalue problem and then used to establish the Birman-Kre\u012dn formula, which relates the  trace  difference  between  functions  of  the  full  and  free  Dirac  operators.   In  turn,  a Poisson wave trace formula in the distributional sense is established via an upper bound counting function and factorization of the scattering matrix determinant.\n\nBoth trace formulas are generalized such that resonances appearing at the threshold points are considered.  Finally, under further restrictions on the potential, the existence of infinitely many Dirac resonances is proved as an application of our trace formulas",

        "abstract": "We investigate how bounds of resonance counting functions for Schottky\nsurfaces behave under transitions to covering surfaces of finite degree. We\nconsider the classical resonance counting function asking for the number of\nresonances in large (and growing) disks centered at the origin of $\\mathbb{C}$,\nas well as the (fractal) resonance counting function asking for the number of\nresonances in boxes near the axis of the critical exponent. For the former\ncounting function we provide a transfer-operator-based proof that bounding\nconstants can be chosen such that the transformation behavior under transition\nto covers is as for the Weyl law in the case of surfaces of finite area. For\nthe latter counting function we deduce a bound in terms of the covering degree\nand the minimal length of a periodic geodesic on the covering surface. This\nyields an improved fractal Weyl upper bound. In the setting of Schottky\nsurfaces, these estimates refine previous results due to Guillop\\'{e}--Zworski\nand Guillop\\'{e}--Lin--Zworski. When applied to principal congruence covers,\nthese results yield new estimates for the resonance counting functions in the\nlevel aspect, which have recently been investigated by Jakobson--Naud. The\ntechniques used in this article are based on the thermodynamic formalism for\n$L$-functions (twisted Selberg zeta functions), and twisted transfer operators.",

The ultimate aim is to establish exponential decay of correlations for H\u00f6lder observables with respect to a very general class of Gibbs measures. The approach invented in 1997 by Dolgopyat in \u201cOn decay of correlations in Anosov flows\u201d and further developed in Stoyanov (2011) is substantially refined here, allowing to deal with much more general situations than before, although we still restrict ourselves to the uniformly hyperbolic case. A rather general procedure is established which produces the desired estimates whenever the Gibbs measure admits a Pesin set with exponentially small tails, that is a Pesin set whose preimages along the flow have measures decaying exponentially fast. We call such Gibbs measures regular. Recent results in Gou\u00ebzel and Stoyanov (2019) prove existence of such Pesin sets for hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and flows for a large variety of Gibbs measures determined by H\u00f6lder continuous potentials. The strong spectral estimates for Ruelle operators and well-established techniques lead to exponential decay of correlations for H\u00f6lder continuous observables, as well as to some other consequences such as: (a) existence of a non-zero analytic continuation of the Ruelle zeta function with a pole at the entropy in a vertical strip containing the entropy in its interior; (b) a Prime Orbit Theorem with an exponentially small error.",

        "abstract": "In this thesis, we study the resonances of the Laplace operator on cusp manifolds. They are manifolds whose ends are real hyperbolic cusps. The resonances were introduced by Selberg in the 50's for the constant curvature cusp surfaces. Their definition was later extended to the case of variable curvature by Lax and Phillips. The resonances are the poles of a meromorphic family of generalized eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. They are associated to the continuous spectrum of the Laplace operator. To analyze this continuous spectrum, different directions of research are investigated.On the one hand, we obtain results on the localization of resonances. In particular, if the curvature is negative, for a generic set of metrics, they split into two sets. The first one is included in a band near the spectrum. The other is composed of resonances that are far from the spectrum. This leaves a log zone without resonances. On the other hand, we study the microlocal measures associated to certain sequences of spectral parameters. In particular we show that for some sequences of parameters that converge to the spectrum, but not too fast, the associated microlocal measure has to be the Liouville measure. This property holds when the curvature is negative.Cette th\u00e8se \u00e0 pour objet l\u2019\u00e9tude des r\u00e9sonances du laplacien sur les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 pointes. Ce sont des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s dont les bouts sont des pointes hyperboliques r\u00e9elles. Ces objets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits par Selberg pour les surfaces \u00e0 pointes de courbure constante dans les ann\u00e9es 50. Leur d\u00e9finition a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendue en courbure variable par Lax et Phillips. Les r\u00e9sonances sont les poles d\u2019une famille m\u00e9romorphe de fonctions propres g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es du laplacien. Elles sont associ\u00e9es au spectre continu du laplacien. Pour analyser ce spectre continu, plusieurs directions de recherche sont explor\u00e9es ici. D\u2019une part, on obtient des r\u00e9sultats sur la localisation de ces r\u00e9sonances. En particulier, si la courbure est n\u00e9gative, on montre que pour un ensemble g\u00e9n\u00e9rique de m\u00e9triques, les r\u00e9sonances se s\u00e9parent en deux ensembles. Le premier est contenu dans une bande pr\u00e8s du spectre continu. L\u2019autre partie est compos\u00e9 de r\u00e9sonances qui s\u2019\u00e9loignent du spectre. Ceci laisse une zone de taille log sans r\u00e9sonance.D\u2019autre part, on \u00e9tudie les mesures microlocales associ\u00e9es \u00e0 certaines suites de param\u00e8tre spectraux. En particulier, on montre que pour des suites de param\u00e8tres spectraux qui s\u2019approche du spectre, mais pas trop vite, la mesure microlocale associ\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessairement la mesure de Liouville. Cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est valable quand la courbure de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 est n\u00e9gative",

        "abstract": "Numerous problems of analysis (real and complex) and geometry (analytic,\nalgebraic, Diophantine e.a.) can be reduced to calculation of the ``number of\nsolutions'' of systems of equations, defined by algebraic equalities and\ndifferential equations with algebraic right hand sides (both ordinary and\nPfaffian). In the purely algebraic context the paradigm is given by the\nB\\'ezout theorem: the number of isolated solutions of a system of polynomial\nequations of degree $\\le d$ in the $n$-dimensional space does not exceed $d^n$,\nthe bound polynomial in $d$ and exponential in $n$. This bound is optimal: if\nwe count solutions properly (i.e., with multiplicities, including complex\nsolutions and solutions on the infinite hyperplane), then the equality holds.\n  This paradigm can be generalized for the transcendental case as described\nabove. It turns out some counting problems admit similar bounds depending only\non the degrees and dimensions, whereas other can be treated only locally, i.e.,\nadmit bounds for the number of solutions in some domains of limited size. There\nis only one class of counting problems, which admits global bounds, but besides\nthe degree and dimension, the answer depends on the height of the corresponding\nPfaffian system.\n  The unifying feature for these results is the core fact that lies at the\nheart of their proofs. This fact can be regarded as a variety of distant\ngeneralizations of the Rolle theorem known from the undergraduate calculus,\nclaiming that between any two roots of a univariate differentiable function on\na segment must lie a root of its derivative. We discuss generalizations of the\nRolle theorem for vector-valued and complex analytic functions (none of them\nstraightforward) and for germs of holomorphic maps.",

We prove that the high-frequency resolvent is\neither bounded by $C_\\epsilon |\\lambda|^\\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon>0$, or\nblows up faster than any polynomial (at least along a subsequence). A stronger\nresult holds if the manifold is analytic. The method of proof is to exploit the\nwarped product structure to separate variables, obtaining a one-dimensional\nsemiclassical Schr\\\"odinger operator. We then classify the microlocal resolvent\nbehaviour associated to every possible type of critical value of the potential,\nand translate this into the associated resolvent estimates. Weakly stable\ntrapping admits highly concentrated quasimodes and fast growth of the\nresolvent. Conversely, using a delicate inhomogeneous blowup procedure loosely\nbased on the classical positive commutator argument, we show that any weakly\nunstable trapping forces at least some spreading of quasimodes.\n  As a first application, we conclude that either there is a resonance free\nregion of size $| \\Im \\lambda | \\leq C_\\epsilon | \\Re \\lambda |^{-1-\\epsilon}$\nfor any $\\epsilon>0$, or there is a sequence of resonances converging to the\nreal axis faster than any polynomial. Again, a stronger result holds if the\nmanifold is analytic. As a second application, we prove a spreading result for\nweak quasimodes in partially rectangular billiards.",

In particular, we show that it is possible to define Banach spaces on which the transfer operator is quasi-compact. (Information on the existence of a Sinai\u2013Ruelle\u2013Bowen measure, its smoothness properties and statistical properties readily follow from such a result.) In dimension d = 2 we show that the transfer operator associated with smooth random perturbations of the map is close, in a proper sense, to the unperturbed transfer operator. This allows us to obtain easily very strong spectral stability results, which, in turn, imply spectral stability results for smooth deterministic perturbations as well. Finally, we are able to implement an Ulam-type finite rank approximation scheme thus reducing the study of the spectral properties of the transfer operator to a finite-dimensional problem.",

Our aim is to investigate the spectrum [tau(1),tau(2), ...] of periods of the periodic orbits. An explicit formula for the density rho(tau)= Sigma(p)delta(tau-tau(p)) is derived in terms of the eigenvalues of the classical evolution operator. The density is naturally decomposed into a smooth part plus an interferent sum over oscillatory terms. The frequencies of the oscillatory terms are given by the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues (Ruelle-Pollicott resonances). For large periods, corrections to the well-known exponential growth of the smooth part of the density are obtained. An alternative formula for rho(tau) in terms of the zeros and poles of the Ruelle zeta function is also discussed. The results are illustrated with the geodesic motion in billiards of constant negative curvature. Connections with the statistical properties of the corresponding quantum eigenvalues, random-matrix theory, and discrete maps are also considered. In particular, a random-matrix conjecture is proposed for the eigenvalues of the classical evolution operator of chaotic billiards.",

This uses the construction of the resolvent given by Mazzeo\nand Melrose (valid when the spectral parameter lies in a compact set), Melrose,\nS\\'a Barreto and Vasy (high energy estimates for a perturbation of the\nhyperbolic metric) and the present authors (see also the work by Yiran Wang) in\nthe general high-energy case.\n  Under the additional assumption that $X$ has negative curvature everywhere,\nwe give two applications of the spectral measure estimates. The first,\nfollowing work due to Guillarmou and Sikora with the second author in the\nasymptotically conic case, is a restriction theorem, that is, a $L^p(X) \\to\nL^{p'}(X)$ operator norm bound on the spectral measure. The second is a\nspectral multiplier result, that is, a bound on functions $F((\\Delta -\nn^2/4)_+^{1/2})$ of the square root of the Laplacian, in terms of norms of the\nfunction $F$. Compared to the asymptotically conic case, our spectral\nmultiplier result is weaker, but the restriction estimate is stronger. In both\ncases, the difference can be traced to the exponential volume growth at\ninfinity for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, as opposed to polynomial\ngrowth in the asymptotically conic setting.\n  The pointwise bounds on the spectral measure established here will also be\napplied to Strichartz estimates in another work by the first author.",

Here, $K_E$ denotes\nthe subset of the classical energy surface $\\{H=E\\}$ which stays bounded for\nall time under the flow generated by the Hamiltonian $H$ and $D(K_E)$ denotes\nits fractal dimension. Since the number of bound states in a quantum system\nwith $n$ degrees of freedom scales like $\\hbar^{-n}$, this suggests that the\nquantity $\\frac{D(K_E)+1}{2}$ represents the effective number of degrees of\nfreedom in scattering problems.",

This bound seems directly computable in large time for some\nRicci flows. In addition, since the result in its most general form is\nindependent of Ricci flow, further applications may be possible.\n  A generally sharp lower bound for the diameters is also given, which depends\nonly on the initial metric, time and $L^\\infty$ bound of the scalar curvature.\nThese results imply that, in finite time, the Ricci flow can neither turn the\ndiameter to infinity nor zero, unless the scalar curvature blows up.",

Although it saw\nmany significant advances in analyzing certain classes of equations, the\nclassification still remains an open problem especially for the higher-order\nequations. One of the main classical methods of Painlev\\'e analysis is based on\nconsidering the resonance numbers corresponding to the possible indices of\narbitrary coefficients in the Laurent expansion of the general solution in a\nneighborhood of a movable singularity. Complex and non-integer values of\nresonance numbers point out to existence of the movable critical singularities\nand positive integer numbers could be used to construct the said general\nsolution. Also the equation always possesses at least one negative resonance\nnumber of $-1$ which corresponds to an arbitrary position of a movable pole.\nHowever our understanding of the role of nontrivial negative resonances\ndifferent from $-1$ remains limited in spite of certain recent methodological\nadvances related to it. And though in the lower-order classifications built so\nfar such equations with nontrivial negative resonances have rather been a\nspecial case, the result of present work demonstrates that negative resonances\nare in fact common for the higher degree ordinary differential equations with\nPainlev\\'e property. Specifically we'll prove that their presence is the\nnecessary condition of the Painlev\\'e property for the equations with degree of\nthe leading terms higher than two.",

We find an explicit\nparameterisation of the discrete resonant wavevectors in terms of two rational\nvariables. We show that these new variables are restricted to a bounded region\nand find this region explicitly. We argue that this can be used to reduce the\ncomplexity of a direct numerical search for discrete triad resonances. Also, we\nintroduce a new direct numerical method to search for discrete resonances. This\nnumerical method has complexity ${\\mathcal{O}}(N^3)$, where $N$ is the largest\nwavenumber in the search. We apply this new method to find all discrete\nirreducible resonant triads in the wavevector box of size $5000$, in a\ncalculation that took about $10.5$ days on a $16$-core machine. Finally, based\non our method of mapping to elliptic curves, we discuss some dynamical\nimplications regarding the spread of quadratic invariants across scales via\nresonant triad interactions, in the form of sharp bounds on the size of the\ninteracting wavevectors.",

By constructing new trial functions, we obtain a sharp\nupper bound of the gap of the consecutive eigenvalues in the sense of the\norder, which affirmatively answers to a conjecture proposed by Chen-Zheng-Yang.\nIn addition, we also exploit the closed eigenvalue problem of Laplacian and\nobtain a similar optimal upper bound. As some important examples, we\ninvestigate the eigenvalues of the eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian on the\nunit sphere and cylinder, compact homogeneous Riemannian manifolds without\nboundary, connected bounded domain and compact complex hypersurface without\nboundary in the standard complex projective space $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}(4)$ with\nholomorphic sectional curvature $4$, and some intrinsic estimates for the\neigenvalue gap is obtained. As the author know, for the Dirichlet problem, the\ngap $\\lambda_{k+1}-\\lambda_{k}$ is bounded by the first $k$-th eigenvalues in\nthe previous literatures. However, by a large number of numerical calculations,\nthe author surprisingly find that the gap of the consecutive eigenvalues of the\nDirichlet problem on the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $R^{n}$ can be bounded\nonly by the first two eigenvalues. Therefore, we venture to conjecture that all\nof the eigenvalues satisfy: $\\lambda_{k+1}-\\lambda_{k}\\leq\n\\mathfrak{S}_{i}(\\Omega)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda_{1})k^{1/n}$, where\n$\\mathfrak{S}_{i}(\\Omega),i=1,2$ denote the first shape coefficient and the\nsecond shape coefficient. In particular, if we consider the second shape\ncoefficient, then there is a close connection between this universal inequality\nand the famous Panye-P\\'olya-Weinberger conjecture in general form. By\ncalculating some important examples, we adduce some good evidence on the\ncorrectness of this conjecture.",

An\nupper bound on $\\lambda_{1}$ in terms of $h$ was established by Buser in 1982\n(with dimensional constants) and improved (to a dimension-free estimate) by\nLedoux in 2004 for smooth Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded\nbelow.\n  The goal of the paper is two fold. First: we sharpen the inequalities\nobtained by Buser and Ledoux obtaining a dimension-free sharp Buser inequality\nfor spaces with (Bakry-\\'Emery weighted) Ricci curvature bounded below by $K\\in\n{\\mathbb R}$ (the inequality is sharp for $K>0$ as equality is obtained on the\nGaussian space). Second: all of our results hold in the higher generality of\n(possibly non-smooth) metric measure spaces with Ricci curvature bounded below\nin synthetic sense, the so-called $ \\mathsf{RCD}(K,\\infty)$ spaces.",

In the\nweakly nonlinear regime, those interactions may facilitate energy equipartition\nin Fourier space. We consider analytically resonant wave-wave interactions for\nthe celebrated Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) system. Using a\nnumber-theoretical approach based on cyclotomic polynomials, we show that the\nproblem of finding exact resonances for a system of N particles is equivalent\nto a Diophantine equation whose solutions depend sensitively on the set of\ndivisors of N. We provide an algorithm to construct all possible resonances,\nbased on two methods: pairing-off and cyclotomic, which we introduce to build\nup explicit solutions to the 4-, 5- and 6-wave resonant conditions. Our results\nshed some light in the understanding of the long-standing FPUT paradox,\nregarding the sensitivity of the resonant manifolds with respect to the number\nof particles N and the corresponding time scale of the interactions leading to\nthermalisation. In this light we demonstrate that 6-wave resonances always\nexist for any N, while 5-wave resonances exist if N is divisible by 3 and N >\n6. It is known (for finite N) that 4-wave resonances do not mix energy across\nthe spectrum, so we investigate whether 5-wave resonances can produce energy\nmixing across a significant region of the Fourier spectrum by analysing the\ninterconnected network of Fourier modes that can interact nonlinearly via\nresonances. The answer depends on the set of odd divisors of N that are not\ndivisible by 3: the size of this set determines the number of dynamically\nindependent components, corresponding to independent constants of motion\n(energies). We show that 6-wave resonances connect all these independent\ncomponents, providing in principle a restoring mechanism for full-scale\nthermalisation.",

This result is of independent interest and it is stated for general\nmaps (not just polynomial); this result implies that small continuous\nperturbations of $\\mathcal{C}^1$ manifolds have a richer topology than the one\nof the original manifold. We then compare the extremal case with a random one\nand prove that on average the topology of $Z$ behaves as the \"square root\" of\nits upper bound: for a random Kostlan map $\\psi:S^m\\to \\mathbb{R}^k$ with\ncomponents of degree $d$, we have: \\begin{equation}\n\\mathbb{E}b(Z)=\\Theta(d^{\\frac{m}{2}}).\\end{equation} This generalizes\nclassical results of Edelman-Kostlan-Shub-Smale from the zero set of a random\nmap, to the structure of its singularities.",

We generalize this classical inequality from\n$d=1$ to higher dimensions $d>1$ with the class of Riesz potentials which\nincludes the logarithmic potential as a special case. In order to quantify how\nclose a probability measure is to the uniform distribution in a general space,\nwe use Wasserstein-infinity distance as a canonical extension of the concept of\ndiscrepancy. Then we give a compact description of this distance. Then for\nevery dimension $d$, we prove inequalities bounding the Wasserstein-infinity\ndistance between a probability measure $\\rho$ and the uniform distribution by\nthe $L^p$-norm of the Riesz potentials generated by $\\rho$. Our inequalities\nare proven to be sharp up to the constants for singular Riesz potentials. Our\nresults indicate that the phenomenon discovered by Erd\\H{o}s and Tur\\'an about\npolynomials is much more universal than it seems. Finally we apply these\ninequalities to prove stability theorems for energy minimizers, which provides\na complementary perspective on the recent construction of energy minimizers\nwith clustering behavior.",

The local part begins with a review\nof doubling indices and freqeuency functions as local measures of fast or slow\ngrowth of eigenfunctions. The pattern of boxes with maximal doubling indices\nplays a central role in the results of Logunov-Malinnokova, giving upper and\nlower bounds for hypersurface measures of nodal sets in the setting of general\n$C^{\\infty}$ metrics. The proofs of both their polynomial upper bound and sharp\nlower bound are sketched. The survey continues with a global proof of the sharp\nupper bound for real analytic metrics (originally proved by Donnelly-Fefferman\nwith local arguments), using analytic continuation to Grauert tubes. Then it\nreviews results of Toth-Zelditch giving sharp upper bounds on Hausdorff\nmeasures of intersections of nodal sets with real analytic submanifolds in the\nreal analytic setting. Last, it goes over lower bounds of Jung-Zelditch on\nnumbers of nodal domains in the case of $C^{\\infty}$ surfaces of non-positive\ncurvature and concave boundary or on negatively curved `real' Riemann surfaces,\nwhich are based on ergodic properties of the geodesic flow and eigenfunctions,\nand on estimates of restrictions of eigenfunctions to hypersurfaces.

Under a natural assumption about the ratio of\nthe wavenumbers, we prove bounds on the solution in terms of the data, with\nthese bounds explicit in all parameters. In particular, the (weighted) $H^1$\nnorm of the solution is bounded by the $L^2$ norm of the source term,\nindependently of the wavenumber. These bounds then imply the existence of a\nresonance-free strip beneath the real axis. The main novelty is that the only\ncomparable results currently in the literature are for smooth, convex obstacles\nwith strictly positive curvature, while here we assume only Lipschitz\nregularity and star-shapedness with respect to a point. Furthermore, our bounds\nare obtained using identities first introduced by Morawetz (essentially\nintegration by parts), whereas the existing bounds use the much-more\nsophisticated technology of microlocal analysis and propagation of\nsingularities. We also recap existing results that show that if the assumption\non the wavenumbers is lifted, then no bound with polynomial dependence on the\nwavenumber is possible.",

In this paper we study how \"degree $k$\npoints\" sit inside zero sets of harmonic polynomials in $\\mathbb R^n$ of degree\n$d$ (for all $n\\geq 2$ and $1\\leq k\\leq d$) and inside sets that admit\narbitrarily good local approximations by zero sets of harmonic polynomials. We\nobtain a general structure theorem for the latter type of sets, including sharp\nHausdorff and Minkowski dimension estimates on the singular set of \"degree $k$\npoints\" ($k\\geq 2$) without proving uniqueness of blowups or aid of PDE methods\nsuch as monotonicity formulas. In addition, we show that in the presence of a\ncertain topological separation condition, the sharp dimension estimates improve\nand depend on the parity of $k$. An application is given to the two-phase free\nboundary regularity problem for harmonic measure below the continuous threshold\nintroduced by Kenig and Toro.",

In this light, it is surprising that a much\nmore powerful transition exists from Charlier polynomials to the Hermite\nfunction, valid for any real value of the parameter. This greatly strengthens\nthe asymptotic connections between Charlier polynomials and special functions,\nwith applications for instance in queueing theory.\n  It is shown in this paper that the convergence is uniform in bounded\nintervals, and a sharp rate bound is proved. It is also shown that there is a\ntransition of derivatives of Charlier polynomials to the derivative of the\nHermite function, again with a sharp rate bound.

We prove two power laws in the small\ncoupling <gamma> \\to 0 and small nonlinearity <mu> \\to 0 regime. The asymptotic\nrelation <mu> ~ C<gamma>^4 characterizes the emergence of a small frequency\ninterval of triple harmonic solutions near the resonant frequency of the\noscillator. As the nonlinearity grows or the coupling diminishes, this interval\nwidens and, at the relation <mu> ~ C<gamma>^2, merges with another evolving\nfrequency interval of triple harmonic solutions that extends to infinity. Our\nmodel allows rigorous computation of stability in the small <mu> and <gamma>\nlimit. In the regime of triple harmonic solutions, those with largest and\nsmallest response of the oscillator are linearly stable and the solution with\nintermediate response is unstable.",

We pay particular attention to the dissipative case, that is, Anosov flows that do not preserve an absolutely continuous measure. Such flows have two distinguished Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen 3-forms, \u03a9_SRB^\u00b1, and the cohomology classes [\u03b9_X\u03a9_SRB^\u00b1] (where X is the infinitesimal generator of the flow) play a key role in the determination of the space of resonant 1-forms. When both classes vanish we associate to the flow a helicity that naturally extends the classical notion associated with null-homologous volume preserving flows. We provide a general theory that includes horocyclic invariance of resonant 1-forms and SRB-measures as well as the local geometry of the maps X\u21a6 [\u03b9_X\u03a9_SRB^\u00b1] near a null-homologous volume preserving flow. Next, we study several relevant classes of examples. Among these are thermostats associated with holomorphic quadratic differentials, giving rise to quasi-Fuchsian flows as introduced by Ghys. For these flows we compute explicitly all resonant 1-forms at zero, we show that [\u03b9_X\u03a9_SRB^\u00b1]=0 and give an explicit formula for the helicity. In addition we show that a generic time change of a quasi-Fuchsian flow is semisimple and thus the order of vanishing of the Ruelle zeta function at zero is -\u03c7(M), the same as in the geodesic flow case. In contrast, we show that if (M,g) is a closed surface of negative curvature, the Gaussian thermostat driven by a (small) harmonic 1-form has a Ruelle zeta function whose order of vanishing at zero is -\u03c7(M)-1.",

We define the resonances of $H=H_0+V$ as the eigenvalues\nof the non-selfadjoint operator obtained from $H$ by analytic distortions of\n$\\R_{x_3}$. We study their distribution near any fixed real eigenvalue of\n$H_0$, $2bq+\\la$ for $q\\in\\N$. In a ring centered at $2bq+\\la$ with radiuses\n$(r,2r)$, we establish an upper bound, as $r$ tends to 0, of the number of\nresonances. This upper bound depends on the decay of $V$ at infinity only in\nthe directions $(x_1,x_2)$. Finally, we deduce a representation of the\nderivative of the spectral shift function (SSF) for the operator pair ($H_0,H$)\nin terms of resonances. This representation justifies the Breit-Wigner\napproximation and implies a local trace formula.",

Next we use them to establish the sharp\n$L^1-L^\\infty$ decay estimates of Schr\\\"odinger groups $e^{-itH}$ generated by\nbi-Schr\\\"odinger operators also with zero resonances. As a consequence,\nStrichartz estimates are obtained for the solution of fourth-order\nSchr\\\"odinger equations with potentials for initial data in\n$L^2({\\mathbf{R}})$. In particular, it should be emphasized that the presence\nof zero resonances does not change the optimal time decay rate of $e^{-itH}$ in\ndimension one, except at requiring faster decay rate of the potential.",

The operators arising in connection with $L$,\nsuch as the heat semigroup and Riesz transform, are not, in general, of\nCalder\\'on-Zygmund type and exhibit behavior different from their counterparts\nbuilt upon the Laplacian. The current paper aims at a thorough description of\nthe properties of such operators in $L^p$, Sobolev, and some new Hardy spaces\nnaturally associated to $L$.\n  First, we show that the known ranges of boundedness in $L^p$ for the heat\nsemigroup and Riesz transform of $L$, are sharp. In particular, the heat\nsemigroup $e^{-tL}$ need not be bounded in $L^p$ if $p\\not\\in\n[2n/(n+2),2n/(n-2)]$. Then we provide a complete description of {\\it all}\nSobolev spaces in which $L$ admits a bounded functional calculus, in\nparticular, where $e^{-tL}$ is bounded.\n  Secondly, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hardy and Lipschitz spaces\nassociated to $L$, that serves the range of $p$ beyond $[2n/(n+2),2n/(n-2)]$.\nIt includes, in particular, characterizations by the sharp maximal function and\nthe Riesz transform (for certain ranges of $p$), as well as the molecular\ndecomposition and duality and interpolation theorems.",

Thus, the following\ncharacterization is obtained: the centered maximal operator satisfies uniform\nweak type $(1,1)$ bounds if and only if the space $X$ has the Besicovitch\nintersection property.\n  In $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with any norm, the constants coming from the Besicovitch\nintersection property are bounded above by the translative kissing numbers. The\nextensive literature on kissing numbers allows us to obtain, first, sharp\nestimates on the uniform bounds satisfied by the centered maximal operators\ndefined by arbitrary norms on the plane, second, sharp estimates in every\ndimension when the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm is used, and third, improved estimates in\nall dimensions when considering euclidean balls, as well as the sharp constant\nin dimension 3.\n  Additionally, we prove that the existence of uniform $L^1$ bounds for the\naveraging operators associated to arbitrary measures and radii, is equivalent\nto a weaker variant of the Besicovitch intersection property.",

It was shown in\n\\cite{Yom3} that the Lebesgue measure in the Remez inequality can be replaced\nby a certain geometric invariant $\\omega_d(Z)$ which can be effectively\nestimated in terms of the metric entropy of $Z$ and which may be nonzero for\ndiscrete and even finite sets $Z$.\n  In the present paper we first obtain an essentially sharp Remez-type\ninequality in the spirit of \\cite{Yom3} for complex polynomials of one\nvariable, introducing metric invariants $c_d(Z)$ and $\\o_{cd}(Z)$ for an\narbitrary subset $Z\\subset D_1\\subset {\\mathbb C}$. These invariants translate\ninto the the metric language the classical Cartan lemma (see \\cite{Gor} and\nreferences therein).\n  Next we introduce $(s,p)$-valent functions, which provide a natural\ngeneralization of $p$-valent ones (see \\cite{Hay} and references therein). We\nprove a \"distortion theorem\" for such functions, comparing them with\npolynomials sharing their zeroes. On this base we extend to $(s,p)$-valent\nfunctions our polynomial Remez-type inequality.\n  As the main example we consider restrictions $g$ of polynomials of a growing\ndegree to a fixed algebraic curve, for which we obtain an essentially sharp\n\"local\" Remez-type inequality, stressing the role of the geometry of\nsingularities of $g$.\n  Finally, we obtain for such functions $g$ a \"global\" Remez-type inequality\nwhich is valid for all the branches of $g$ and involves both the geometry of\nsingularities of $g$ and its monodromy.",

In this work, we describe two variants of the Gauss\nCircle problem that exhibit similar characteristics.\n  The first variant concerns sums of Fourier coefficients of $\\text{GL}(2)$\ncusp forms. These sums behave very similarly to the error term in the Gauss\nCircle problem. We introduce new Dirichlet series with coefficients that are\nsquares of partial sums of Fourier coefficients of cusp forms. We study the\nmeromorphic properties of these Dirichlet series and use these series to give\nnew perspectives on the mean square of the size of sums of these Fourier\ncoefficients.\n  The second variant concerns the number of lattice points of bounded size on\none-sheeted hyperboloids. This problem is very similar to counting the number\nof lattice points within a spheres of various dimensions, except with the\nadditional constraint of lying on a hyperboloid. It turns out that this problem\nis equivalent to estimating sums of the shape $\\sum r_d(n^2 + h)$, where\n$r_d(m)$ is the number of representations of $m$ as a sum of $d$ squares.

We also consider the\napplications of the transfer operator in thermodynamic formalism.\nThe original motivation stems from studies of one-dimensional PWEs.\nIn particular, any one dimensional mixing PWE admits a unique\nabsolutely continuous invariant probability measure (ACIP) and this\nACIP has a bounded variation density. The methodology used to prove\nthe existence of this ACIP is based on a so-called functional\nanalytic approach and a key step in this approach is to show that\nthe corresponding transfer operator has a spectral gap. Moreover,\nwhen a PWE has Markov property this ACIP can also be viewed as a\nGibbs measure in thermodynamic formalism.\n\nIn this thesis, we extend the studies on one-dimensional PWEs in\nseveral aspects. First, we use the functional analytic approach to\nstudy piecewise area preserving maps (PAPs) in particular to search\nfor the ACIPs with multidimensional bounded variation densities. We\nalso explore the relationship between the uniqueness of ACIPs with\nbounded variation densities and topological transitivity/ minimality\nfor PWIs.\n\nSecond, we consider the mixing and corresponding mixing rate\nproperties of a collection of piecewise linear Markov maps generated\nby composing x to mx mod 1 with permutations in SN. We show that typical permutations preserve the mixing property under\nthe composition. Moreover, by applying the Fredholm determinant\napproach, we calculate the mixing rate via spectral gaps and obtain\nthe max/min spectral gaps when m,N are fixed. The spectral gaps\ncan be made arbitrarily small when the permutations are fully\nrefined.\n\nFinally, we consider the computations of fractal dimensions for\ngeneralized Moran constructions, where different iteration function\nsystems are applied on different levels. By using the techniques in\nthermodynamic formalism, we approximate the fractal dimensions via\nthe zeros of the Bowen's equation on the pressure functions\ntruncated at each level",

Besides, this upper\nbound for the first nonzero Wentzell eigenvalue can be achieved if and only if\nthese two geodesic balls are isometric with each other. This conclusion can be\nseen as an extension of eigenvalue comparisons in [7,22]. Second, we prove a\ngeneral Reilly formula for the drifting Laplacian, and then use the formula to\ngive a sharp lower bound for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of the\ndrifting Laplacian on compact smooth metric measure spaces with boundary and\nconvex potential function. Besides, this lower bound can be achieved only for\nthe Euclidean ball of the prescribed radius. This conclusion gives a partial\nanswer to the famous Escobar's conjecture proposed in [6].",

These amplitudes take an\ninfinite-product form and, depending on parameters, exhibit mass spectra that\nare either unbounded or bounded, thus corresponding to generalizations of the\nVeneziano and Coon amplitudes, respectively. For the bounded case, masses\nconverge to an accumulation point, a peculiar feature seen in the Coon\namplitude but more recently understood to arise naturally in string theory.\nImportantly, our amplitudes contain free parameters allowing for the\ncustomization of the slope and offset of the spin-dependence in the Regge\ntrajectory. We compute all partial waves for this multi-parameter class of\namplitudes and identify unitary regions of parameter space. For the unbounded\ncase, we apply similar methods to derive new deformations of the Veneziano and\nVirasoro-Shapiro amplitudes.",

In this work we\ndiscuss an example of such a domain perturbation. Let $\\Omega$ be a (not\n{necessarily} bounded) domain in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We perturb it to $\n\\Omega_\\varepsilon=\\Omega\\setminus \\cup_{k=1}^m S_{k,\\varepsilon},$ where\n$S_{k,\\varepsilon}$ are closed surfaces with small suitably scaled holes\n(``windows'') through which the bounded domains enclosed by these surfaces\n(``resonators'') are connected to the outer domain. When $\\varepsilon$ goes to\nzero, the resonators shrink to points. We prove that in the limit\n$\\varepsilon\\to 0$ the spectrum of the Laplacian on $\\Omega_\\varepsilon$ with\nthe Neumann boundary conditions on $S_{k,\\varepsilon}$ and the Dirichlet\nboundary conditions on the outer boundary converges to the union of the\nspectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\\Omega$ and the numbers $\\gamma_k$,\n$k=1,\\dots,m$, being equal $1/4$ times the limit of the ratio between the\ncapacity of the $k$th window and the volume of the $k$th resonator. We obtain\nan estimate on the rate of this convergence with respect to the Hausdorff-type\nmetrics. Also, an application of this result is presented: we construct an\nunbounded waveguide-like domain with inserted resonators such that the\neigenvalues of the Laplacian on this domain lying below the essential spectrum\nthreshold do coincide with prescribed numbers.",

Contact equivalence provides a way to study the associated\nconfiguration hypersurface. In the contact equivalence class of any\nconfiguration polynomial we identify a polynomial with minimal number of\nvariables; it is a configuration polynomial. This minimal number is bounded by\n$r+1\\choose 2$, where $r$ is the rank of the underlying matroid. We show that\nthe number of equivalence classes is finite exactly up to rank $3$ and list\nexplicit normal forms for these classes.",

In fact, our method obtains the asymptotically sharp constant in G\\'al's\ntheorem, which is new. Our approach also gives a transparent explanation of the\nrelationship between the maximal size of the Riemann zeta function on vertical\nlines and bounds on GCD sums; a point which was previously unclear. Furthermore\nwe obtain sharp bounds on the spectral norm of GCD matrices which settles a\nquestion raised in [2]. We use bounds for the spectral norm to show that series\nformed out of dilates of periodic functions of bounded variation converge\nalmost everywhere if the coefficients of the series are in $L^2 (\\log\\log\n1/L)^{\\gamma}$, with $\\gamma > 2$. This was previously known with $\\gamma >4$,\nand is known to fail for $\\gamma<2$. We also develop a sharp Carleson-Hunt-type\ntheorem for functions of bounded variations which settles another question\nraised in [1]. Finally we obtain almost sure bounds for partial sums of dilates\nof periodic functions of bounded variations improving [1]. This implies almost\nsure bounds for the discrepancy of $\\{n_k x\\}$ with $n_k$ an arbitrary growing\nsequences of integers.",

        "abstract": "The Mahler measure of a polynomial is a measure of complexity formed by\ntaking the modulus of the leading coefficient times the modulus of the product\nof its roots outside the unit circle. The roots of a real degree $N$ polynomial\nchosen uniformly from the set of polynomials of Mahler measure at most 1 yields\na Pfaffian point process on the complex plane. When $N$ is large, with\nprobability tending to 1, the roots tend to the unit circle, and we investigate\nthe asymptotics of the scaled kernel in a neighborhood of a point on the unit\ncircle. When this point is away from the real axis (on which there is a\npositive probability of finding a root) the scaled process degenerates to a\ndeterminantal point process with the same local statistics (i.e., scalar\nkernel) as the limiting process formed from the roots of complex polynomials\nchosen uniformly from the set of polynomials of Mahler measure at most 1. Three\nnew matrix kernels appear in a neighborhood of $\\pm 1$ which encode information\nabout the correlations between real roots, between complex roots and between\nreal and complex roots. Away from the unit circle, the kernels converge to new\nlimiting kernels, which imply among other things that the expected number of\nroots in any open subset of $\\C$ disjoint from the unit circle converges to a\npositive number. We also give ensembles with identical statistics drawn from\ntwo-dimensional electrostatics with potential theoretic weights, and normal\nmatrices chosen with regard to their topological entropy as actions on\nEuclidean space.",

We\nshow the continuous-time Ollivier-Ricci curvature is well-defined for a large\nclass of Markovian and non-Markovian random walks and provide a criterion for\nexistence of continuous-time Ollivier-Ricci curvature; the said results\ngeneralize the previous rather limited constructions in the literature. In\naddition, important properties of both discrete-time and continuous-time\nOllivier-Ricci curvatures are obtained including -- to name a few -- Lipschitz\ncontinuity, concavity properties, piece-wise regularity (piece-wise linearity\nin the case of linear walks) for the discrete-time Ollivier-Ricci as well as\nLipschitz continuity and limit-free formulation for the continuous-time\nOllivier-Ricci. these properties were previously known only for very specific\ndistances and very specific random walks. As an application of Lipschitz\ncontinuity, we obtain existence and uniqueness of generalized continuous-time\nOllivier-Ricci curvature flows. Along the way, we obtain -- by optimizing\nMcMullen's upper bounds -- a sharp upper bound estimate on the number of\nvertices of a convex polytope in terms of number of its facets and the ambient\ndimension, which might be of independent interest in convex geometry. The said\nupper bound allows us to bound the number of polynomial pieces of the\ndiscrete-time Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a function of time in the\ntime-polynomial random walk. The limit-free formulation we establish allows us\nto define an operator theoretic Ollivier-Ricci curvature which is a non-linear\nconcave functional on suitable operator spaces.",

The\nnonlinear evolution becomes differentiable in Hoelder spaces on the cigar. The\nlinearization of the dynamics is given by the Laplace-Beltrami operator plus a\ntransport term (which can be suppressed by introducing appropriate weights into\nthe function space norm), plus a finite-depth potential well with a universal\nprofile. In the limiting case of the (linear) heat equation, the depth\ndiverges, the number of eigenstates increases without bound, and the continuous\nspectrum recedes to infinity. We provide a detailed study of the linear and\nnonlinear problems in Hoelder spaces on the cigar, including a sharp\nboundedness estimate for the semi-group, and use this as a tool to obtain sharp\nconvergence results toward the Barenblatt solution, and higher order\nasymptotics. In finer convergence results (after modding out symmetries of the\nproblem), a subtle interplay between convergence rates and tail behavior is\nrevealed. The difficulties involved in choosing the right functional spaces in\nwhich to carry out the analysis can be interpreted as genuine features of the\nequation rather than mere annoying technicalities.",

In turn, this\nboundary trace theory serves as a platform for developing a spectral theory for\nSchr\\\"odinger operators on bounded Lipschitz domains, along with their\nassociated Weyl-Titchmarsh operators. Overall, this pushes the present state of\nknowledge a significant step further. For example, we succeed in extending the\nDirichlet and Neumann trace operators in such a way that all self-adjoint\nextensions of a Schr\\\"odinger operator on a bounded Lipschitz domain may be\ndescribed with explicit boundary conditions, thus providing a final answer to a\nproblem that has been investigated for more than 60 years in the mathematical\nliterature. Along the way, a number of other open problems are solved. The most\ngeneral geometric and analytic setting in which the theory developed here\nyields satisfactory results is that of Lipschitz subdomains of Riemannian\nmanifolds and for the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator (in place of the\nstandard flat-space Laplacian). In particular, such an extension yields results\nfor variable coefficient Schr\\\"odinger operators on bounded Lipschitz domains.",

The latter are usually referred to as\nMeyer-type lemmas and are traditionally attacked by combining weighted\ninequalities with sharp estimates for maximal directional averaging operators.\nThis classical approach fails to give sharp bounds. In this article we develop\na novel framework for square function estimates, based on directional Carleson\nembedding theorems and multi-parameter time-frequency analysis, which overcomes\nthe limitations of weighted theory. In particular we prove the sharp form of\nMeyer's lemma, namely a sharp operator norm bound for vector-valued directional\nsingular integrals, in both one and two parameters, in terms of the cardinality\nof the given set of directions. Our sharp Meyer lemma implies an improved\nquantification of the reverse square function estimate for tangential\n$\\delta\\times \\delta^2$-caps on $\\mathbb S^1$. We also prove sharp square\nfunction estimates for conical and radial multipliers. A suitable combination\nof these estimates yields a new and currently best known bound for the Fourier\nrestriction to a $N$-gon, improving on previous results of A. C\\'ordoba.",

Such a result, known as a Prime Orbit Theorem, follows from our quantitative study of the holomorphic extension properties of the associated dynamical zeta functions and dynamical Dirichlet series. In particular, the above result applies to postcritically-finite rational maps whose Julia set is the whole Riemann sphere. Moreover, we prove that the regularity conditions needed here are generic; and for a Latt\u00e8s map f and a continuously differentiable (eventually) positive function \u03d5, such a Prime Orbit Theorem holds if and only if \u03d5 is not co-homologous to a constant.",

As pointed out in\n\\cite{Liu91, Liu97}, the key to obtaining sharp bounds is to take account of\ncancellation associated with the property that the solution decays faster along\ncharacteristic than in other directions. Thus, we must here estimate\ncharacteristic derivatives for the entire nonlinear perturbation, rather than\njudicially chosen parts as in \\cite{Ra, HR}. a requirement that greatly\ncomplicates the analysis.",

We find that the norm induced by this inner product governs weak\nconvergence at each place of $K$. The canonical adelic measure associated to a\nrational map is in this vector space, and the square of the norm of the\ndifference of two such adelic measures is the Arakelov-Zhang pairing from\narithmetic dynamics. We prove a sharp lower bound on the norm of adelic\nmeasures with points of small adelic height. We find that the norm of a\ncanonical adelic measure associated to a rational map is commensurate with the\nArakelov height on the space of rational functions with fixed degree. As a\nconsequence, the Arakelov-Zhang pairing of two rational maps $f$ and $g$ can be\nbounded from below as a function of $g$.",

We focus on polynomials\nwhere the typical values of the coefficients have power growth and count the\naverage number of real zeros. Almost all previous results require coefficients\nwith zero mean, and it is non-trivial to extend these results to the general\ncase. Our approach is based on a novel comparison principle that reduces the\ngeneral situation to the mean-zero setting. As applications, we obtain new\nresults for the Kac polynomials, hyperbolic random polynomials, their\nderivatives, and generalizations of these polynomials. The proof features new\nlogarithmic integrability estimates for random polynomials (both local and\nglobal) and fairly sharp estimates for the local number of real zeros.",

        "abstract": "Information-theoretic inequalities play a fundamental role in numerous\nscientific and technological areas as they generally express the impossibility\nto have a complete description of a system via a finite number of information\nmeasures. In particular, they gave rise to the design of various quantifiers\n(statistical complexity measures) of the internal complexity of a (quantum)\nsystem. In this paper, we introduce a three-parametric Fisher-R\\'enyi\ncomplexity, named $(p,\\beta,\\lambda)$-Fisher--R\\'enyi complexity. This\ncomplexity measure quantifies the combined balance of the spreading and the\ngradient contents of $\\rho$, and has the three main properties of a statistical\ncomplexity: the invariance under translation and scaling transformations, and a\nuniversal bounding from below. The latter is proved by generalizing the Stam\ninequality, which lowerbounds the product of the Shannon entropy power and the\nFisher information of a probability density function. An extension of this\ninequality was already proposed by Bercher and Lutwak, a particular case of the\ngeneral one, where the three parameters are linked, allowing to determine the\nsharp lower bound and the associated probability density with minimal\ncomplexity. Using the notion of differential-escort deformation, we are able to\ndetermine the sharp bound of the complexity measure even when the three\nparameters are decoupled (in a certain range). We determine as well the\ndistribution that saturates the inequality: the $(p,\\beta,\\lambda)$-Gaussian\ndistribution, which involves an inverse incomplete beta function. Finally, the\ncomplexity measure is calculated for various quantum-mechanical states of the\nharmonic and hydrogenic systems, which are the two main prototypes of physical\nsystems subject to a central potential.",

The coefficient $K_2$ is the\nambient dimension $n$ in the first case and $n-1$ in the second case.

Our results can be considered as wide\ngeneralizations of classical results on the distribution of eigenvalues of\ncompact operators, which correspond to the case $L_0=0$.

Our method employs complex\nanalysis and a new finite-dimensional reduction, allowing us to avoid using the\nexisting theory of determinants in Banach spaces, which would require strong\nrestrictions on $K$. Several open questions regarding the sharpness of our\nresults are raised, and an example is constructed showing that there are some\nessential differences in the possible distribution of eigenvalues of operators\nin general Banach spaces, compared to the Hilbert space case.",

We show that sharp variations in the envelope of the\nincident pulse may initiate unusual, counterintuitive dynamics of the\nscattering associated with interference of modes with fast and slow relaxation.\nTo exhibit the power of the models, we apply them to explain the dynamic light\nscattering of a square-envelope pulse by an infinite circular cylinder made of\n$GaP$, when the pulse carrier frequency lies in the vicinity of the destructive\ninterference at the Fano resonances. We observe and explain intensive sharp\nspikes in scattering cross section just behind the leading and trailing edges\nof the incident pulse. The latter occurs when the incident pulse is over and is\nexplained by the electromagnetic energy released in the particle at the\nprevious scattering stages. The accuracy of the models is checked against their\ncomparison with results of the direct numerical integration of the complete set\nof Maxwell's equations and occurs very high. The models' advantages and\ndisadvantages are revealed, and the ways to apply them to other types of\ndynamic resonant scattering are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Many physical problems such as Allen-Cahn flows have natural maximum\nprinciples which yield strong point-wise control of the physical solutions in\nterms of the boundary data, the initial conditions and the operator\ncoefficients. Sharp/strict maximum principles insomuch of fundamental\nimportance for the continuous problem often do not persist under numerical\ndiscretization. A lot of past research concentrates on designing fine numerical\nschemes which preserves the sharp maximum principles especially for nonlinear\nproblems. However these sharp principles not only sometimes introduce unwanted\nstringent conditions on the numerical schemes but also completely leaves many\npowerful frequency-based methods unattended and rarely analyzed directly in the\nsharp maximum norm topology. A prominent example is the spectral methods in the\nfamily of weighted residual methods.\n  In this work we introduce and develop a new framework of almost sharp maximum\nprinciples which allow the numerical solutions to deviate from the sharp bound\nby a controllable discretization error: we call them effective maximum\nprinciples. We showcase the analysis for the classical Fourier spectral methods\nincluding Fourier Galerkin and Fourier collocation in space with forward Euler\nin time or second order Strang splitting. The model equations include the\nAllen-Cahn equations with double well potential, the Burgers equation and the\nNavier-Stokes equations. We give a comprehensive proof of the effective maximum\nprinciples under very general parametric conditions.",

More recently Yoccoz proved MLC\nfor all at most finitely renormalizable parameter values. One of our goals is\nto prove MLC for some infinitely renormalizable parameter values. Loosely\nspeaking, we need all renormalizations to have bounded combinatorial rotation\nnumber (assumption C1) and sufficiently high combinatorial type (assumption\nC2).\n  For real quadratic polynomials of bounded combinatorial type the complex a\npriori bounds were obtained by Sullivan. Our result complements the Sullivan's\nresult in the unbounded case. Moreover, it gives a background for Sullivan's\nrenormalization theory for some bounded type polynomials outside the real line\nwhere the problem of a priori bounds was not handled before for any single\npolynomial.\n  An important consequence of a priori bounds is absence of invariant\nmeasurable line fields on the Julia set (McMullen) which is equivalent to\nquasi-conformal (qc) rigidity. To prove stronger topological rigidity we\nconstruct a qc conjugacy between any two topologically conjugate polynomials\n(Theorem III). We do this by means of a pull-back argument, based on the linear\ngrowth of moduli and a priori bounds. Actually the argument gives the stronger\ncombinatorial rigidity which implies MLC.",

Explicit bounds are based on\ntwo sharp well-known distortion results: the quasiconformal Schwarz lemma and\nthe bound for linear dilatation. Moreover, Bernoulli type inequalities and\nasymptotically sharp bounds for special functions involving complete elliptic\nintegrals are applied to simplify the computations. Finally, we discuss the\nbehavior of the quasihyperbolic metric under quasiconformal maps and prove a\nsharp result for quasiconformal maps of R^n \\ {0} onto itself.",

This number, denoted by $N$, is\ndefined as the minimum dimension such that for $n\\ge N$, arbitrary\n$n$-dimensional balls in phase space centred on the solution trajectory\n$\\omega(x,y,t)$, for $t>0$, contract under the dynamics of the system\nlinearized about $\\omega(x,y,t)$. In other words, $N$ is the minimum number of\ngreatest Lyapunov exponents whose sum becomes negative. It is found that $N\\le\nC_1R_e$ when the phase space is endowed with the energy norm, and $N\\le\nC_2R_e(1+\\ln R_e)^{1/3}$ when the phase space is endowed with the enstrophy\nnorm. Here $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constant and $R_e$ is the Reynolds number\ndefined in terms of $\\omega_0$, the system length scale, and the viscosity\n$\\nu$. The linear (or nearly linear) dependence of $N$ on $R_e$ is consistent\nwith the estimate for the number of active modes deduced from a recent\nmathematical bound for the viscous dissipation wave number. This result is in a\nsharp contrast to the forced case, for which well-known estimates for the\nHausdorff dimension $D_H$ of the global attractor scale highly superlinearly\nwith $\\nu^{-1}$. We argue that the \"extra\" dependence of $D_H$ on $\\nu^{-1}$ is\nnot an intrinsic property of the turbulent dynamics. Rather, it is a \"removable\nartifact,\" brought about by the use of a time-independent forcing as a model\nfor energy and enstrophy injection that drives the turbulence.",

In particular, this shows that if the ball of radius r has size\nslightly greater than r^2 then this probability is bounded from below. On the\nother hand, we show that if the ball of radius r has volume slightly less than\nr^3 then this probability decays logarithmically for all larger balls. These\nresults represent a finitary refinement of Varopoulos's theorem that a random\nwalk on a vertex-transitive graph is recurrent if and only if the graph has at\nmost quadratic volume growth. They also combine to show that there is a gap for\nescape probabilities: there exists a universal constant c such that the random\nwalk on an arbitrary vertex-transitive graph is either recurrent or has a\nprobability of at least c of escaping to infinity. We also prove versions of\nthese results for finite graphs, in particular confirming and strengthening a\nconjecture of Benjamini and Kozma from 2002. Amongst other things, we also\ngenerlise our results to give a sharp finitary version of the characterisation\nof p-parabolic vertex-transitive graphs, and prove a number of sharp\nisoperimetric inequalities for vertex-transitive graphs.",

Bound and\nresonant states of the Schr\\\"odinger equation can be determined through the\npoles of the S-matrix, a quantity that can be derived from the asymptotic form\nof the wave function. We introduce a regularization procedure that essentially\ntransforms the S-matrix into its inverse and improves its smoothness\nproperties, thus making it amenable to numerical continuation. This allows us\nto automate the process of tracking bound and resonant states when parameters\nin the Schr\\\"odinger equation are varied. We have applied this approach to a\nnumber of model problems with satisfying results.",

This property is no longer valid\nfor other values of the parameters; in general, zeros are complex. In this\npaper we study the strong asymptotics of Jacobi polynomials where the real\nparameters $\\alpha_n,\\beta_n$ depend on $n$ in such a way that $$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\alpha_{n}}{n}=A, \\quad\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\beta_{n}}{n}=B, $$ with $A,B \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We\nrestrict our attention to the case where the limits $A,B$ are not both positive\nand take values outside of the triangle bounded by the straight lines A=0, B=0\nand $A+B+2=0$. As a corollary, we show that in the limit the zeros distribute\nalong certain curves that constitute trajectories of a quadratic differential.\n  The non-hermitian orthogonality relations for Jacobi polynomials with varying\nparameters lie in the core of our approach; in the cases we consider, these\nrelations hold on a single contour of the complex plane. The asymptotic\nanalysis is performed using the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method based on the\nRiemann-Hilbert reformulation of Jacobi polynomials.",

If\n$\\Omega$ is simply connected then the spectrum reduces to the spectrum of the\nusual Neumann Laplacian; therefore we focus on multiply connected domains\nbounded by convex curves and prove lower bounds for its ground state depending\non the geometry and the topology of $\\Omega$. Besides the area, the perimeter\nand the diameter, the geometric invariants which play a crucial role in the\nestimates are the the fluxes of the potential one-form around the inner holes\nand the distance between the boundary components of the domain; more precisely,\nthe ratio between its minimal and maximal width. Then, we give a lower bound\nfor doubly connected domains which is sharp in terms of this ratio, and a\ngeneral lower bound for domains with an arbitrary number of holes. When the\ninner holes shrink to points, we obtain as a corollary a lower bound for the\nfirst eigenvalue of the so-called Aharonov-Bohm operators with an arbitrary\nnumber of poles.",

Besides the quasilinear nature of the equations,\nthe main difficulty is to handle the weak small divisors bounds for quadratic\nand cubic interactions, growing with the size of the largest frequency. To\novercome this difficulty we use (1) the (Hamiltonian) structure of the\nequations which gives additional smoothing close to the resonant hypersurfaces,\n(2) another structural property, connected to time-reversibility, that allows\nus to handle \"trivial\" cubic resonances, (3) sharp small divisors lower bounds\non three and four-waves modulation functions based on counting arguments, and\n(4) partial normal form transformations and symmetrization arguments in the\nFourier space.

A problem posed by Chowla and by\nCassaigne-Ferenczi-Mauduit-Rivat-S\\'ark\\\"ozy asks to show that if $P(x)\\in\n\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, then the sequence $\\lambda(P(n))$ changes sign infinitely\noften, assuming only that $P(x)$ is not the square of another polynomial. We\nshow that the sequence $\\lambda(P(n))$ indeed changes sign infinitely often,\nprovided that either (i) $P$ factorizes into linear factors over the rationals;\nor (ii) $P$ is a reducible cubic polynomial; or (iii) $P$ factorizes into a\nproduct of any number of quadratics of a certain type; or (iv) $P$ is any\npolynomial not belonging to an exceptional set of density zero. Concerning (i),\nwe prove more generally that the partial sums of $g(P(n))$ for $g$ a bounded\nmultiplicative function exhibit nontrivial cancellation under necessary and\nsufficient conditions on $g$. This establishes a \"99% version\" of Elliott's\nconjecture for multiplicative functions taking values in the roots of unity of\nsome order. Part (iv) also generalizes to the setting of $g(P(n))$ and provides\na multiplicative function analogue of a recent result of Skorobogatov and Sofos\non almost all polynomials attaining a prime value.",

In this\npaper, we develop new robust techniques based on the recent progress in the\ntheory of sharp thresholds and the sprinkling method of Benjamini and Tassion.\nOn $\\mathbb Z^d$, these methods lead to a completely new proof of the slab\nresult of Grimmett and Marstrand.",

The extremal polynomials are naturally called integer Chebyshev\npolynomials. Their factors, zero distribution and asymptotics are the main\nsubjects of this paper. In particular, we show that the integer Chebyshev\npolynomials for any infinite subset of the real line must have infinitely many\ndistinct factors, which answers a question of Borwein and Erd\\'{e}lyi.\nFurthermore, it is proved that the accumulation set for their zeros must be of\npositive capacity in this case.\n  We also find the first nontrivial examples of explicit integer Chebyshev\nconstants for certain classes of lemniscates. Since it is rarely possible to\nobtain an exact value of integer Chebyshev constant, good estimates are of\nspecial importance.\n  Introducing the methods of weighted potential theory, we generalize and\nimprove the Hilbert-Fekete upper bound for integer Chebyshev constant. These\nmethods also give bounds for the multiplicities of factors of integer Chebyshev\npolynomials, and lower bounds for integer Chebyshev constant. Moreover, all the\nmentioned bounds can be found numerically, by using various extremal point\ntechniques, such as weighted Leja points algorithm. Applying our results in the\nclassical case of the segment $[0,1]$, we improve the known bounds for the\ninteger Chebyshev constant and the multiplicities of factors of the integer\nChebyshev polynomials.",

The unperturbed dynamical system has a bound state\nwith frequency $\\omega$, a spatially localized and time periodic solution. In\nquantum mechanics, metastable states, which last longer than expected, have\nbeen observed. These metastable states are a consequence of the instability of\nthe bound state under the nonlinear Fermi's Golden Rule.\n  In this study, we explore the underlying mathematical instability mechanism\nfrom the bound state to these metastable states. Besides, we derive the sharp\nenergy transfer rate from discrete to continuum modes, when the discrete\nspectrum was not close to the continuous spectrum of the Sch\\\"ordinger operator\n$H= -\\Delta + V + m^2$, i.e. weak resonance regime $ \\sigma_c(\\sqrt{H}) = [m,\n\\infty)$, $0< 3\\omega < m$. This extends the work of Soffer and Weinstein\n\\cite{SW1999} for resonance regime $3\\omega > m$ and confirms their conjecture\nin \\cite{SW1999}. Our proof relies on a more refined version of normal form\ntransformation of Bambusi and Cuccagna \\cite{BC}, the generalized Fermi's\nGolden Rule, as well as certain weighted dispersive estimates.",

Furthemore,\nwe give a quantitative description of how the genus drops as a sequence of\nminimal surfaces converges smoothly, with mutiplicity $m\\geq 1$, away from\nfinitely many points where curvature concentration may happen.

For every pair\n$(k, n) \\in \\mathbb{N}^2$, where $n \\geq 7$ and $k \\in [3, n-3]$, we prove that\nit is possible to find a $\\{0, 1\\}$--polynomial $f(z)$ of degree $\\text{deg\n}{f}=n$ with non--zero constant term $f(0) \\ne 0$, such that $N(f)=k$ and $f(z)\n\\ne 0$ on the unit circle $\\partial\\mathcal{D}$. On the way to this goal, we\nanswer a question of D.~W.~Boyd from 1986 on the smallest degree Newman\npolynomial that satisfies $|f(z)| > 2$ on the unit circle $\\partial\n\\mathcal{D}$. This polynomial is of degree $38$ and we use this special\npolynomial in our constructions. We also identify (without a proof) all\nexceptional $(k, n)$ with $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, n-3, n-2, n-1\\}$, for which no such\n$\\{0, 1\\}$--polynomial of degree $n$ exists: such pairs are related to regular\n(real and complex) Pisot numbers.\n  Similar, but less complete results for $\\{-1, 1\\}$ polynomials are\nestablished. We also look at the products of spaced Newman polynomials and\nconsider the rotated large Littlewood polynomials. Lastly, based on our data,\nwe formulate a natural conjecture about the statistical distribution of $N(f)$\nin the set of Newman and Littlewood polynomials.",

A polynomial\nof this class describes the volume of the set V+tB^n as a function of t, where\nt is a positive number and B^n denotes the unit ball in R. The second class,\nthe class of Weyl polynomials, consists of polynomials, each associated with a\nRiemannian manifold M, where M} is isometrically embedded with positive\ncodimension in R^n. A Weyl polynomial describes the volume of a tubular\nneighborhood of its associated M as a function of the tube's radius. These\npolynomials are calculated explicitly in a number of natural examples such as\nballs, cubes, squeezed cylinders. Furthermore, we examine how the above\nmentioned polynomials are related to one another and how they depend on the\nstandard embedding of R^n into R^m for m>n. We find that in some cases the real\npart of any Steiner polynomial root will be negative. In certain other cases, a\nSteiner polynomial will have only real negative roots. In all of this cases, it\ncan be shown that all of a Weyl polynomial's roots are simple and, furthermore,\nthat they lie on the imaginary axis.

We study the dimension of bounded\nand divergent orbits of $g_t$ emanating from a class of curves lying on leaves\nof the unstable foliation of $g_t$ on the homogeneous space $G/\\Gamma$. We\nobtain sharp upper bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of divergent on average\norbits and show that the set of bounded orbits is winning in the sense of\nSchmidt (and, hence, has full dimension). The class of curves we study is\nroughly characterized by being tangent to copies of $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$\ninside $G$, which are not contained in a proper parabolic subgroup of $G$.\n  We describe applications of our results to problems in Diophantine\napproximation by number fields and intrinsic Diophantine approximation on\nspheres. Our methods also yield the following result for lines in the space of\nsquare systems of linear forms: suppose $\\varphi(s) = sY + Z$ where $Y\\in\n\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ and $Z\\in M_{n,n}(\\mathbb{R})$. Then, the dimension\nof the set of points $s$ such that $\\varphi(s)$ is singular is at most $1/2$\nwhile badly approximable points have Hausdorff dimension equal to $1$.",

We also investigate the dimension theory of these spirals,\nin particular, the Assouad dimension, Assouad spectrum and box dimensions. The\naim here is to compare the bounds on the H\\\"{o}lder exponents in the winding\nproblem coming directly from knowledge of dimension (and how dimension distorts\nunder H\\\"{o}lder image) with the sharp results. We find that the Assouad\nspectrum provides the best information, but that even this is not sharp.

Similarly, for a\nSchr\\\"odinger operator $H = -\\Delta+V$, determine the existence of algorithms\nthat can compute the spectrum $\\mathrm{sp}(H)$ given point samples of the\npotential function $V$. In order to solve these problems, we establish the\nSolvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy and provide a collection of new\nalgorithms that allow for problems that were previously out of reach. The SCI\nis the smallest number of limits needed in the computation, yielding a\nclassification hierarchy for all types of problems in computational mathematics\nthat determines the boundaries of what computers can achieve in scientific\ncomputing. In addition, the SCI hierarchy provides classifications of\ncomputational problems that can be used in computer-assisted proofs. The SCI\nhierarchy captures many key computational issues in the history of mathematics\nincluding the insolvability of the quintic, Smale's problem on the existence of\niterative generally convergent algorithm for polynomial root finding, the\ncomputational spectral problem, inverse problems, optimisation etc.",

The proof is based on the randomized algorithm\napproach introduced by Schramm and Steif and gives quantitative polynomial\nbounds on the noise sensitivity of crossing events for Bargmann-Fock. A rather\ncounter-intuitive consequence is as follows. Let $F$ be a Bargmann-Fock\nGaussian field in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and consider two horizontal planes $P_1,P_2$\nat small distance $\\varepsilon$ from each other. Even though $F$ is a.s.\nanalytic, the above noise sensitivity statement implies that the full\nrestriction of $F$ to $P_1$ (i.e. $F_{| P_1}$) gives almost no information on\nthe percolation configuration induced by $F_{|P_2}$. As an application of this\nnoise sensitivity analysis, we provide a Schramm-Steif based proof that the\nnear-critical window of level line percolation around $\\ell_c=0$ is\npolynomially small. This new approach extends earlier sharp threshold results\nto a larger family of planar Gaussian fields.",

We begin by giving a brief overview of\ntheir extremal properties in classic and more recent work. We also give a\ncompact form for Suffridge polynomials which matches a general pattern\ndiscovered by Brandt. Our approach allows us to find the coefficients which\nBrandt's result was not giving explicitly. This new presentation provides us\nthe tools to obtain an estimate of the rate of approximation of the generalized\nKoebe functions by univalent polynomials. Furthermore, we consider the\npresentation of Suffridge polynomials in Robertson's form and find the suiting\nRobertson measure. This suggests a new way to approximate step functions by\ncontinuous monotonic ones. We then study the lack of robustness of the\nunivalency of these polynomials and suggest a new family of polynomials for\nwhich we conjecture the univalency of a subclass. Namely, we prove the quite\nsurprising fact that by extending the family by letting the discrete argument\nin the polynomial coefficients become continuous one does not increase the set\nof univalent polynomials. Only the initial polynomials remain univalent. In\nthis new one parameter family generalizing the Suffridge polynomials, it is\nremarkable that the Suffridge polynomials are already extremal as they\ncorrespond to the choice of the parameter set to 1; moreover the complex\nFej\\'er polynomials correspond the choice of the parameter set to 0, and the\nchoice of the parameter set to -1 corresponds the polynomials $z+(z^N/N)$.\nRemarkably, computer simulations seem to clearly indicate that the image of the\nunit disc under these new polynomial mapping is a simply-connected region\nbounded by a simple curve. This justifies the conjectural univalency of these\npolynomials for the whole range of the parameters.",

We show how to present correlation functions of interest as part of\na sum-of-squares polynomial using the stationarity of the statistics. That\nallows us to find how the moments of the mode amplitudes depend on the degree\nof non-equilibrium (analog of the Reynolds number), which reveals some\nproperties of marginal statistical distributions. By combining scaling\ndependence with the results of direct numerical simulations, we obtain the\nprobability densities of both modes in a highly intermittent inverse cascade.\nWe also show that the relative phase between modes tends to $\\pi/2$ and\n$-\\pi/2$ in the direct and inverse cascades as the Reynolds number tends to\ninfinity, and derive bounds on the phase variance.

We show that a number of functional properties, which\ntypically hold when the curvature is bounded, remain true in this setting.\nThese include the characterization of Sobolev spaces on manifolds, the\nso-called Cald\\'eron-Zygmund inequalities and the $L^p$-positivity preserving\nproperty, i.e. $u\\in L^p\\ \\&\\ (-\\Delta + 1)u\\ge 0 \\Rightarrow u\\ge 0$. The main\ntool is a new class of first and second order Hardy-type inequalities on\nCartan-Hadamard manifolds with a polynomial upper bound on the curvature.\n  In the last part of the manuscript we prove the $L^p$-positivity preserving\nproperty, $p\\in[1,+\\infty]$, on manifolds with subquadratic negative part of\nthe Ricci curvature. This generalizes an idea of B. G\\\"uneysu and gives a new\nproof of a well-known condition for the stochastic completeness due to P. Hsu.",

Special attention is paid to discussing a variety of examples illustrating the general theory rather than to providing complete statements of the results and their proofs, for which we refer to the author's previous (joint) books mentioned in the paper. Finally, in an epilogue (4), entitled \"From quantized number theory to fractal cohomology\", we briefly survey aspects of related work (motivated in part by the theory of complex fractal dimensions) of the author with H. Herichi (in the real case) [HerLap1], along with [Lap8], and with T.

Since the classical moving-plane method based on the Kelvin\ntransform and maximum principle fails in dealing with the high-order elliptic\nequations in $\\mathbb{S}^n$, we first employ the Mobius transform between\n$\\mathbb{S}^n$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$, poly-harmonic average and iteration\narguments to show that the higher-order Lane-Emden equation on $\\mathbb{S}^n$\nis equivalent to some integral equation in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Then we apply the\nmethod of moving plane in integral forms and the symmetry of sphere to obtain\nthe uniqueness of nonnegative solutions to the higher-order Lane-Emden\nequations with subcritical polynomial growth on $\\mathbb{S}^n$. As an\napplication, we also identify the best constants and classify the extremals of\nthe sharp subcritical high-order Sobolev inequalities involving the GJMS\noperators on $\\mathbb{S}^n$. Our results do not seem to be in the literature\neven for the Lane-Emden equation and sharp subcritical Sobolev inequalities for\nfirst order derivatives on $\\mathbb{S}^n$.",

This is a model for the transfer operators associated to geodesic flows on negatively curved manifolds (or contact Anosov flows). We restrict the prequantum transfer operator to the N-th Fourier mode with respect to the U(1) action and investigate the spectral property in the limit N->infinity, regarding the transfer operator as a Fourier integral operator and using semi-classical analysis. In the main result, we show a \" band structure \" of the spectrum, that is, the spectrum is contained in a few separated annuli and a disk concentric at the origin. We show that, with the special (H\\\"older continuous) potential V0=1/2 log |det Df_x|_{E_u}|, the outermost annulus is the unit circle and separated from the other parts. For this, we use an extension of the transfer operator to the Grassmanian bundle. Using Atiyah-Bott trace formula, we establish the Gutzwiller trace formula with exponentially small reminder for large time. We show also that, for a potential V such that the outermost annulus is separated from the other parts, most of the eigenvalues in the outermost annulus concentrate on a circle of radius exp where denotes the spatial average on M. The number of these eigenvalues is given by the \"Weyl law\", that is, N^d.Vol(M) with d=1/2. dim(M) in the leading order. We develop a semiclassical calculus associated to the prequantum operator by defining quantization of observables Op(psi) in an intrinsic way. We obtain that the semiclassical Egorov formula of quantum transport is exact. We interpret all these results from a physical point of view as the emergence of quantum dynamics in the classical correlation functions for large time. We compare these results with standard quantization (geometric quantization) in quantum chaos.",

We prove a uniform in $N$\nlower tail bound on the fluctuation scale for the location $x_N(N)$ of the\nright-most particle at time $N$ when started from step initial condition. Our\nargument relies on a map from the $q$-Whittaker measure to a model of periodic\nlast passage percolation (LPP) with geometric weights in an infinite strip that\nwas recently established in [arXiv:2106.11922]. By a path routing argument we\nbound the passage time in the periodic environment in terms of an infinite sum\nof independent passage times for standard LPP on $N\\times N$ squares with\ngeometric weights whose parameters decay geometrically. To prove our tail bound\nresult we combine this reduction with a concentration inequality, and a crucial\nnew technical result -- lower tail bounds on $N\\times N$ last passage times\nuniformly over all $N \\in \\mathbb N$ and all the geometric parameters in\n$(0,1)$. This technical result uses Widom's trick [arXiv:math/0108008] and an\nadaptation of an idea of Ledoux introduced for the GUE [Led05a] to reduce the\nuniform lower tail bound to uniform asymptotics for very high moments, up to\norder $N$, of the Meixner ensemble. This we accomplish by first obtaining sharp\nuniform estimates for factorial moments of the Meixner ensemble from an\nexplicit combinatorial formula of Ledoux [Led05b], and translating them to\npolynomial bounds via a further careful analysis and delicate cancellation.",

Such methods construct an optimal index\nset that corresponds to the sharp estimates of the polynomial coefficients. Our\nanalysis furthermore represents a new approach for estimating best $M$-term\napproximation errors by means of coefficient bounds, without using Stechkin\ninequality. The framework we propose for analyzing asymptotic truncation errors\nis based on an extension of the underlying multi-index set into a continuous\ndomain, and then an approximation of the cardinality (number of integer\nmulti-indices) by its Lebesgue measure. Several types of isotropic and\nanisotropic (weighted) multi-index sets are explored, and rigorous proofs\nreveal sharp asymptotic error estimates in which we achieve sub-exponential\nconvergence rates of the form $M \\exp(-(\\kappa M)^{1/N})$, with $\\kappa$ a\nconstant depending on the shape and size of multi-index sets) with respect to\nthe total number of degrees of freedom. Through several theoretical examples,\nwe explicitly derive the constant $\\kappa$ and use the resulting sharp bounds\nto illustrate the effectiveness of Legendre over Taylor approximations, as well\nas compare our rates of convergence with current published results.\nComputational evidence complements the theory and shows the advantage of our\ngeneralized framework compared to previously developed estimates.",
