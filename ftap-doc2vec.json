We propose a mathematical framework for the risk\nanalysis of such strategies, based on a description in terms of price\nexcursions, first in a pathwise setting, without probabilistic assumptions,\nthen in a Markovian setting.\n  We introduce the notion of delta-excursion, defined as a path which deviates\nby delta from a reference level before returning to this level. We show that\nevery continuous path has a unique decomposition into delta-excursions, which\nis useful for the scenario analysis of dynamic trading strategies, leading to\nsimple expressions for the number of trades, realized profit, maximum loss and\ndrawdown. As delta is decreased to zero, properties of this decomposition\nrelate to the local time of the path.\n  When the underlying asset follows a Markov process, we combine these results\nwith Ito's excursion theory to obtain a tractable decomposition of the process\nas a concatenation of independent delta-excursions, whose distribution is\ndescribed in terms of Ito's excursion measure. We provide analytical results\nfor linear diffusions and give new examples of stochastic processes for\nflexible and tractable modeling of excursions. Finally, we describe a\nnon-parametric scenario simulation method for generating paths whose excursion\nproperties match those observed in empirical data.",

Buyers can sometimes see posted prices faced by\nother buyers, and changing the price frequently could be considered unfair. The\nliterature on posted price mechanisms and prophet inequality problems has\nstudied the two extremes of pricing policies, the fixed price policy and fully\ndynamic pricing. The former is suboptimal in revenue but is perceived as fairer\nthan the latter. This work examines the middle situation, where there are at\nmost $k$ distinct prices over the selling horizon. Using the framework of\nprophet inequalities with independent and identically distributed random\nvariables, we propose a new prophet inequality for strategies that use at most\n$k$ thresholds. We present asymptotic results in $k$ and results for small\nvalues of $k$. For $k=2$ prices, we show an improvement of at least $11\\%$ over\nthe best fixed-price solution. Moreover, $k=5$ prices suffice to guarantee\nalmost $99\\%$ of the approximation factor obtained by a fully dynamic policy\nthat uses an arbitrary number of prices. From a technical standpoint, we use an\ninfinite-dimensional linear program in our analysis; this formulation could be\nof independent interest to other online selection problems.",

Moreover, the distributions returns scaled by the realized standard deviations are also Gaussian. Furthermore, the realized logarithmic standard deviations and correlations all show strong dependence and appear to be well described by long-memory processes, consistent with our documentation of remarkably precise scaling laws under temporal aggregation. Our results also show that positive returns have less impact on future variances and correlations than negative returns of the same absolute magnitude, although the economic importance of this asymmetry is minor. Finally, there is strong evidence that equity volatilities and correlations move together, thus diminishing the benefits to diversification when the market is most volatile. By explicitly incorporating each of these stylized facts, our findings set the stage for improved high-dimensional volatility modeling and out-of-sample forecasting, which in turn hold promise for the development of better decision making in practical situations of risk management, portfolio allocation, and asset pricing.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we offer a MD (Minimum Discrepancy) reformulation of the estimation and inference problem that arises in SD analysis, delivering a method that retains the desirable properties of optimal GMM while offering better higher order ones and, most importantly, without requiring the estimation of the weighting matrix, which is typically unstable and, especially when the cross-section of test-asset payoffs is large compared to the sample period length, subject to substantial sampling error. Moreover, when testing for stochastic dominance/efficiency of a given evaluated portfolio, our method makes it straightforward to impose a no short sales restriction on the admissible allocations to the test assets. While important in practice in certain circumstance, this is instead very hard, if not impossible, in a traditional GMM setting. In an empirical application using 51 years of data on portfolios formed sorting stocks on size and size and book-to-market, we find that, under decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) as well as more restrictive parametric specifications of the utility function, the market portfolio is stochastically dominated by the size and book to market portfolios while it compares favorably to the size portfolios.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a search-theoretic model of the cross-sectional distribution of asset returns, abstracting from risk premia and focusing exclusively on liquidity. I derive a float-adjusted return model (FARM), explaining the pricing of liquidity with a simple linear formula: In equilibrium, the liquidity spread of an asset is proportional to the inverse of its free float, the portion of its market capitalization available for sale. This suggests that the free float is an appropriate measure of liquidity, consistent with the linear specifications commonly estimated in the empirical literature. The qualitative predictions of the model corroborate much of the empirical evidence.",

The structure of turbo warrants is similar to barrier options, but a lookback rebate will be paid if the barrier is crossed by the underlying asset price. Therefore, the turbo warrant price satisfies a partial differential equation (PDE) with a boundary condition that depends on another boundary-value problem (BVP) of PDE. Due to the highly complicated structure of turbo warrants, their valuation presents a challenging problem in the field of financial mathematics. This paper applies the homotopy analysis method to construct an analytic pricing formula for turbo warrants under stochastic volatility in a PDE framework.",

In this article, we present a mechanism for the presence of a stochastic covariance matrix in financial markets, and provide an explanation for the returns' heavy tailed joint distribution. This mechanism relies on sampling returns according to an appropriate event time. Using CAC 40 high-frequency data, we compare the predictions of our model with real-world statistics and find very good agreement. \u00a7Even single asset derivatives desks are sensitive to shifts in correlation if, for instance, they are focused on a specific sectorial or geographic exposure.",

        "abstract": "A macroeconomic model based on the economic variables (i) assets, (ii) leverage (defined as debt over asset) and (iii) trust (defined as the maximum sustainable leverage) is proposed to investigate the role of credit in the dynamics of economic growth, and how credit may be associated with both economic performance and confidence. Our first notable finding is the mechanism of reward/penalty associated with patience, as quantified by the return on assets. In regular economies where the EBITA/Assets ratio is larger than the cost of debt, starting with a trust higher than leverage results in the highest long-term return on assets (which can be seen as a proxy for economic growth). Our second main finding concerns a recommendation for the reaction of a central bank to an external shock that affects negatively the economic growth. We find that late policy intervention in the model economy results in the highest long-term return on assets and largest asset value. But this comes at the cost of suffering longer from the crisis until the intervention occurs. The phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that postponing intervention allows trust to increase first, and it is most effective to intervene when trust is high. These results derive from two fundamental assumptions underlying our model: (a) trust tends to increase when it is above leverage; (b) economic agents learn optimally to adjust debt for a given level of trust and amount of assets. Using a Markov Switching Model for the EBITA/Assets ratio, we have successfully calibrated our model to the empirical data of the return on equity of the EURO STOXX 50 for the time period 2000-2013. We find that dynamics of leverage and trust can be highly non-monotonous with curved trajectories, as a result of the nonlinear coupling between the variables.",

        "abstract": "We develop a general equilibrium model linking the pricing of stocks and corporate bonds to endogenous movements in corporate leverage and aggregate volatility. Our equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms making optimal investment and financing decisions under uncertainty connects fluctuations in quantities and asset prices to movements in the cross-sectional distribution of firms. Countercyclical leverage drives predictable variation in risk premia, and debt-financed growth option exercise generates a high value premium. Endogenous default drives countercyclical credit spreads that are propagated into the real economy through their effects on investment. Endogenous leverage comes with higher and countercyclical aggregate volatility, producing large and skewed business cycles, with sharper, more pronounced, recessions. \u2217We are grateful to comments from Andy Abel, Hui Chen, Urban Jermann, Aubhik Kahn, Dmitry Livdan, Monika Piazzesi (editor) Neng Wang, three anonymous referees and participants at seminars in Calgary, CarnegieMellon, Duke, Wharton, NY Fed, Richmond Fed, ECB, UBC, UCLA, and Imperial College, as well as the following conferences: AFA, SED, Minnesota Macro Week, NBER Capital Markets, NYU Five Star, Rimini Macro-Finance, UCSB-LAEF, Venice C.R.E.D.I.T, and ESSFM Gerzensee.

Then, we solve the problem\nof the institutional investor given the optimal signal-adaptive strategy of the\nhigh-frequency trader, in terms of the resolvent of a Fredholm integral\nequation, thus establishing the unique multi-period Stackelberg equilibrium of\nthe game. Our results provide an explicit solution to the game, which shows\nthat the high-frequency trader can adopt either predatory or cooperative\nstrategies in each period, depending on the tradeoff between the order-flow and\nthe trading signal. We also show that the institutional investor's strategy is\nconsiderably more profitable when the order-flow of the high-frequency trader\nis taken into account in her trading strategy.",

The variability in the covariance risk fails to explain the cross-sectional and time series variation in expected stock returns.

The approach demonstrated in\nour work is quite generalized and can be used to predict the stock price for\nany company, given that the HMM is trained on the dataset of that company's\nstocks dataset.

However, systems with\nsingular switching manifolds still lack such well-established dynamics,\nalthough present in many relevant models of phenomena where multiple switches\nor multiple abrupt changes occur. At this work, we leverage a methodology that,\nthrough blow-ups and singular perturbation, allows the extension of Filippov\ndynamics to the singular case. Specifically, tridimensional systems whose\nswitching manifold consists of an algebraic manifold with transversal\nself-intersection are considered. This configuration, known as double\ndiscontinuity, represents systems with two switches and whose singular part\nconsists of a straight line, where ordinary Filippov dynamics is not directly\napplicable. For the general, non-linear case, beyond defining the so-called\nfundamental dynamics over the singular part, general theorems on its\nqualitative behavior are provided. For the affine case, however, theorems fully\ndescribing the fundamental dynamics are obtained. Finally, this fine-grained\ncontrol over the dynamics is leveraged to derive Peixoto like theorems\ncharacterizing semi-local structural stability.",

We\nsignificantly extend this result by proving that, for a variety of (even\nnon-sum-bounded) utilitarian and egalitarian social functions and for a broad\ngeneralization of the class of weighted congestion games with non-negative (and\npossibly decreasing) latency functions, the worst-case price of anarchy of\n$\\epsilon$-approximate coarse correlated equilibria still coincides with that\nof $\\epsilon$-approximate pure Nash equilibria, for any $\\epsilon\\geq 0$. As a\nbyproduct of our proof, it also follows that such a value can always be\ndetermined by making use of the primal-dual method we introduced in a previous\nwork. It is important to note that our scenario of investigation is beyond the\nscope of application of the robust price of anarchy (for as it is currently\ndefined), so that our result seems unlikely to be alternatively proved via the\nsmoothness framework.",

In this paper,\nwe first develop a successive convex optimization (SCO) approach for solving\nthe OPD problem and show that the SCO algorithm converges to a KKT point of its\ntransformed problem. Second, we propose an effective global algorithm for the\nOPD problem, which integrates the SCO method, simple convex relaxation and a\nbranch-and-bound framework, to identify a global optimal solution to the OPD\nproblem within a pre-specified $\\epsilon$-tolerance. We establish the global\nconvergence of our algorithm and estimate its complexity. We also conduct\nnumerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nalgorithms with both the real data and the randomly generated medium- and\nlarge-scale OPD problem instances.",

Thus, taking into account the price impact in option pricing is an\nimportant issue. This issue has been dealt with, to some extent, for illiquid\nmarkets by assuming a continuous process, mainly based on the Brownian motion.\nHowever, the recent financial crisis and its effects on the global stock\nmarkets have propagated the urgent need for more realistic models where the\nstochastic process describing the price trajectories involves random jumps.\nNonetheless, works related to markets with jumps are scant compared to the\ncontinuous ones. In addition, these previous studies do not deal with illiquid\nmarkets. The contribution of this paper is to tackle the pricing problem for\noptions in illiquid markets with jumps as well as the hedging strategy within\nthis context, which is the first of its kind to the best knowledge.",

Using archival data from LSE,\ndatabases and annual reports, and applying a multifactor framework, the\nempirical results suggested that changes in reserves as well as the components\nof these changes where associated with share returns though insignificantly due\nto the significant impact of oil price and longitudinal effect posed by\napplying the measurement approach with utilizes historical returns. However,\nthe quality of reserves disclosures has a positively significant relationship\nwith share returns. The volatility and decline in oil price is also reflected\nin both low average share returns at -0.4% and low average growth in reserves\nat 8.94% for the last 8 years in the sector.",

With all of the Fama-French (2015) state variables, this analysis is the first exploration of whether the pervasive asset pricing anomalies persist after the econometrician accounts for the time variation in multifactor risk premia. The ubiquitous anomalies of size, value, momentum, investment, profitability, short-term return reversal, and long-term return reversal, disappear after the econometrician takes into account the dynamic nature of multifactor risk premia. The prior linear empirical asset pricing models arise as special cases of this dynamic multifactor model. The main contribution of the current paper relates to the design of a workhorse model in the asset pricing literature. The previous linear empirical asset pricing models can be viewed as special cases of this more general dynamic multifactor model. This dynamic multifactor model carries important implications for equity cost estimation, corporate event assessment, financial risk management, and mutual fund performance evaluation. My dynamic analysis of multifactor risk premia from the Fama-French (2015) five-factor model proposes raising the hurdle for the conventional asset pricing tests. This recommendation serves as the time-series equivalent to the cross-sectional thesis of Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2015).",

In this work, we show that many\nrelevant problems directly fall or can be reformulated into this class of\nMINLPs. We present the branch-and-price algorithm and demonstrate its\neffectiveness (and sometimes ineffectiveness) in an extensive computational\nstudy considering multiple large-scale problems of practical relevance, showing\nthat, in many cases, orders-of-magnitude reductions in solution time can be\nachieved.",

However, when situations become irregular, deviations on the price\nscale can often be extreme and difficult to pinpoint precisely, which is a\nresult of the highly varying marginal costs of generating facilities at the\nedges of the load curve. In these situations it is useful to supplant a point\nforecast of price with a distributional forecast, in particular one whose tails\nare adaptive to the current production regime. This work outlines a methodology\nfor leveraging published bid/ask information from the Nord Pool market to\nconstruct such adaptive predictive distributions. Our methodology is a\nnon-standard application of the concept of error-dressing, which couples a\nfeature driven error distribution in volume space with a non-linear\ntransformation via the published bid/ask curves to obtain highly non-symmetric,\nadaptive price distributions. Using data from the Nord Pool market, we show\nthat our method outperforms more standard forms of distributional modeling. We\nfurther show how such distributions can be used to render `warning systems'\nthat issue reliable probabilities of prices exceeding various important\nthresholds.",

Abstract We study robust notions of good-deal hedging and valuation under combined uncertainty about the drifts and volatilities of asset prices. Good-deal bounds are determined by a subset of risk-neutral pricing measures such that not only opportunities for arbitrage are excluded but also deals that are too good, by restricting instantaneous Sharpe ratios. A non-dominated multiple priors approach to model uncertainty (ambiguity) leads to worst-case good-deal bounds. Corresponding hedging strategies arise as minimizers of a suitable coherent risk measure. Good-deal bounds and hedges for measurable claims are characterized by solutions to secondorder backward stochastic differential equations whose generators are non-convex in the volatility. These hedging strategies are robust with respect to uncertainty in the sense that their tracking errors satisfy a supermartingale property under all a-priori valuation measures, uniformly over all priors.

Playing a strategic game\nleads not only to the estimation of the game's value but also points to the\nequilibrium points (saddle points) and to the conditions of market\nstabilization.

The strategies of both players will be a combination of\nimplementation, market and marketing parameters. This will be described as an\nexample in the introduction (chapter 1). The next chapters (2 and 3) are\nproposals for estimating the effects of strategy selection, i.e. creating\npayoffs for players.

Recent financial studies found that the momentum spillovers of relevant firms are salient as well for measuring asset risk. However, previous studies on asset pricing via machine learning only relied on partial of these market information types. In this study, a deep learning framework is proposed to combine these three market information types with different data structures, that is, numerical economic indicators represented as scalars, media represented as textual vectors, and the influences of related firms captured by graphs. More importantly, the unique data characteristics brought by such data fusion are well addressed in the proposed learning framework. Specifically, a matrix\u2010based module is first proposed to fuse numerical economic data and textual media, which specifically considers the interactions of the fused features. Such fused information, along with the firm relevance represented in graphs, is further integrated by a novel self\u2010adaptive graph neural network that can address the dynamic merging of multilinked listed firms. Experiments performed on real market data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art algorithms, including eLSTM, RGCN, and TGC.",

        "abstract": "Efficient pricing of multi-asset options is a challenging problem in\nquantitative finance. When the Fourier transform of the density function is\navailable, Fourier-based pricing methods become very competitive compared to\nalternative techniques because the integrand in the frequency space has often\nhigher regularity than in the physical space. However, when designing a\nnumerical quadrature method for most of these Fourier pricing approaches, two\nkey aspects affecting the numerical complexity should be carefully considered:\n(i) the choice of the damping parameters that ensure integrability and control\nthe regularity class of the integrand and (ii) the effective treatment of the\nhigh dimensionality of the integration problem. To address these challenges,\nbased on the extension of the one-dimensional Fourier valuation formula to the\nmultivariate case, we propose an efficient numerical method for pricing\nEuropean multi-asset options based on two complementary ideas. First, we smooth\nthe Fourier integrand via an optimized choice of damping parameters based on a\nproposed heuristic optimization rule. Second, we use the adaptive sparse grid\nquadrature based on sparsification and dimension-adaptivity techniques to\naccelerate the convergence of the numerical quadrature in high dimensions.\nThrough an extensive numerical study on the basket and rainbow options under\nthe multivariate geometric Brownian motion and some multivariate L\\'evy models,\nwe demonstrate the advantages of adaptivity and our damping parameter rule on\nthe numerical complexity of the quadrature methods. Moreover, we reveal that\nour approach achieves substantial computational gains compared to the Monte\nCarlo method for different dimensions and parameter constellations.",

        "abstract": "Currently, there exists a disturbing urban problem exemplified by the excessive luxury apartments and glamorous office towers being built in cities around the world in the face of the increasing unaffordability of housing and low-cost work, trade or craft space. Seeking to address this complex problem, this paper proposes a theoretical framework that uniquely addresses both the capitalist economic structure that drives the development process and the Marxist-based urban theory by which the socio-economic outcomes are currently evaluated. This framework takes as its meta-theory, the approach of Thomas Piketty in his recent treatise, \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century\", since he deftly employs the Marxist dialectic of labor/capital while investigating the persistent inequality in the history of capitalism by interrogating that system itself. This bifurcated framework of economic analysis affords a new format for examining real estate returns, how they are represented in the market place, who benefits from them, and how resultant inequalities might be avoided in urban development.",

To characterize network\nexternalities as a function of the number of participants, we consider\ndifferent bounded and unbounded user utility models. The bounded utility model\nfits many infrastructure sharing applications with bounded network value, in\nwhich complete coverage has a finite user valuation (e.g., WiFi or hotspot).\nThe unbounded utility model fits the large scale data sharing and explosion in\nsocial media, where it is expected that the network value follows Metcalfe's or\nZipf's law. For both models, we analyze the optimal pricing schemes to select\nheterogeneous users in the platform under complete and incomplete information\nof users' service valuations. We propose the concept of price of information\n(PoI) to characterize the profit loss due to lack of information, and present\nprovable PoI bounds for different utility models. We show that the PoI=2 for\nthe bounded utility model, meaning that just half of profit is lost, whereas\nthe PoI>=2 for the unbounded utility model and increases as for a less concave\nutility function. We also show that the complicated differentiated pricing\nscheme which is optimal under incomplete user information, can be replaced by a\nsingle uniform price scheme that is asymptotic optimal. Finally, we extend our\npricing schemes to a two-sided market by including a new group of `pure'\nservice users contributing no externalities, and show that the platform may\ncharge zero price to the original group of users in order to attract the pure\nuser group.",

The smooth ambiguity model accommodates both ambiguity (uncertainty) and risk. For an incomplete, competitive asset market, we develop a revealed preference test for asset demand to be consistent with the maximization of smooth ambiguity preferences; and we show that ambiguity preferences constructed from finite observations converge to underlying ambiguity preferences as observations become dense. Subsequently, we give sufficient conditions for the asset demand generated by smooth ambiguity preferences to identify the ambiguity and risk indices as well as the ambiguity probability measure. We do not require ambiguity beliefs to be observable: in a generalized specification, they may not even be defined. An ambiguity free asset plays an important role for identification.",

As a complement to the growing literature on spectral design of\ncovariance kernels, the core of our proposal is to model power spectral\ndensities through a rectangular function, which results in a kernel based on\nthe sinc function with straightforward extensions to non-centred (around zero\nfrequency) and frequency-varying cases. In addition to its use in regression,\nthe relationship between the sinc kernel and the classic theory is illuminated,\nin particular, the Shannon-Nyquist theorem is interpreted as posterior\nreconstruction under the proposed kernel. Additionally, we show that the sinc\nkernel is instrumental in two fundamental signal processing applications:\nfirst, in stereo amplitude modulation, where the non-centred sinc kernel arises\nnaturally. Second, for band-pass filtering, where the proposed kernel allows\nfor a Bayesian treatment that is robust to observation noise and missing data.\nThe developed theory is complemented with illustrative graphic examples and\nvalidated experimentally using real-world data.",

Using Prospect Theory (a Nobel-Prize-winning behavioral\neconomic theory that captures human decision making and its deviation from\nEUT), we design data pricing and channel allocation algorithms for use in\ncognitive radio networks by formulating a game theoretic analysis of the\ninterplay between the price offerings, bandwidth allocation by the SP and the\nservice choices made by end-users. We show that, when the end-users\nunder-weight the service guarantee, they tend to reject the offer which results\nin under-utilization of radio resources and revenue loss. We propose prospect\npricing, a pricing mechanism that can make the system robust to decision making\nand improve radio resource management.

        "abstract": "I find that stocks with high sensitivities to changes in the VIX slope exhibit high returns on average. The price of VIX slope risk is approximately 2.5% annually, statistically significant and cannot be explained by other common factors, such as the market excess return, size, book-to-market, momentum, liquidity, market volatility, and the variance risk premium. I provide a theoretical model that supports my empirical results. The model extends current rare disaster models to include disasters of different lengths. My model implies that a downward sloping VIX term structure anticipates a potential long disaster and vice versa.",

The main conclusion of the paper is that, contrary to the individual risk economies, moral hazard is compatible with trading in competitive linear financial contracts, and gives rise to no manipulation problem. We establish existence of nonmanipulable equilibria provided that there are no relative price effects (e.g., a one-commoditiy economy), and that financial markets display nonlinearly homogeneous payoffs (e.g., nominal), and are sufficiently incomplete. Finally, we justify the linear contract as the optimal pricing schedule in a specific trading game with an auctioneer.moral hazard; linear contracts",

This is motivated by bond markets in which the continuum of assets corresponds to the continuum of possible maturities. Our framework is well adapted to the study of no-arbitrage properties and related hedging problems. In particular, we extend the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing of Guasoni, R\u00e1sonyi and L\u00e9pinette (2012) which concentrates on the one dimensional case. Namely, we prove that the Robust No Free Lunch with Vanishing Risk assumption is equivalent to the existence of a Strictly Consistent Price System. Interestingly, the presence of transaction costs allows a natural definition of trading strategies and avoids all the technical and un-natural restrictions due to stochastic integration that appear in bond models without friction. We restrict to the case where exchange rates are continuous in time and leave the general c\u00e0dl\u00e0g case for further studies.",

Then we show that, if the\nunderlying portfolio contains a dominant asset, buy and hold on that specific\nasset is asymptotically log-optimal with a sublinear rate of convergence. This\nresult also extends to the scenario where a trader either does not have a\nprobabilistic model for the returns or does not trust a model obtained from\nhistorical data. To be more specific, we show that if a market contains a\ndominant asset, buy and hold a market portfolio involving nonzero weights for\neach asset is asymptotically log-optimal. Additionally, this paper also\nincludes a conjecture regarding the property called high-frequency maximality.\nThat is, in the absence of transaction costs, high-frequency rebalancing is\nunbeatable in the ELG sense. Support for the conjecture, involving a lemma for\na weak version of the conjecture, is provided. This conjecture, if true,\nenables us to improve the log-optimality result obtained previously. Finally, a\nresult that indicates a way regarding an issue about when should one to\nrebalance their portfolio if needed, is also provided. Examples, some involving\nsimulations with historical data, are also provided along the way to illustrate\nthe~theory.",

        "abstract": "This paper shows that consumption-based asset pricing puzzles arise from using globally concave-shaped consumption utility. We empirically find that asset returns correlate negatively with many individuals' low-quantile consumption growth. This finding challenges most mainstream models and supports an asset pricing model based on an S-shaped consumption utility. This new model explains both the low covariance between consumption growth and stock returns and a high equity premium. Moreover, this model shows that applying globally concave-shaped consumption utility mistakenly leads to a positive correlation between risky returns and stochastic discount factors of many individuals, a root for many pricing puzzles.",
