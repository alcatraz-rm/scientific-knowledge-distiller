We\ninvestigated the time-averaged characteristics of the interaction between the\nmain elements of the system, the star, the disk, the wind from the disk, and\nthe jet. Rates of exchange of mass and angular momentum between the elements of\nthe system are derived as a function of the main parameters. The propeller\nmechanism may be responsible for the fast spinning-down of the classical T\nTauri stars in the initial stages of their evolution, and for the spinning-down\nof accreting millisecond pulsars.Comment: 18 pages, 16 figures, ApJ (accepted), added references, corrected\n  typos; see animation at\n  http://astrosun2.astro.cornell.edu/us-rus/disk_prop.ht"

After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the \u2018Pak-China Friendship Year\u2019. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to \u201cbetter men\u201d (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi\u2019s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi's policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Current study was quantitative in nature. All elementary level enrolled students at government schools in the province of the Punjab made the population of the study. Multistage sampling was used to select the sample from four districts of one division (Sargodha) of the Punjab province i.e., Sargodha. A sample size i.e., n=960; students and their parents were participated in this study. Research scales i.e. Parenting Styles Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ) was adapted to analyze and measure parents\u2019 parenting styles and an achievement test was developed to measure the academic achievement of the elementary students. After pilot testing, reliability coefficient Cronbach Alpha values for PSDQ and achievement test were 0.67 and 0.71 Data was collected and analyzed using frequencies count, percentages, mean scores and one way ANOVA. Major findings of the study were; Majority of the parents had authoritative parental style, a handsome number of parents keep connection of warmth and support with their children, show intimacy, focus on discipline, do not grant autonomy to their children, do not indulge with their children and as well as a handsome number of students were confident during their studies and study, further, found that parental style had positive relationship with academic achievement. Recommendations were made on the basis of findings and conclusion such as arrangement of Parents Teachers Meetings (PTM\u2018s), parents\u2019 training, provision of incentives and facilities to motivate families might be an inclusive component of elementary education program.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators\u2019 demand for sovereignty and revocation of \u2018Special Status\u2019 of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia\u2019s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of \u2018positivity\u2019, \u2018evasion\u2019 and \u2018influence and power\u2019, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan\u2019s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

All the students from two years master (M.A) degree programme and four years (BS) degree programme of eight departments from International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI), Faculty of Social Sciences were taken as a population of the study. 475 students were randomly selected as a sample of the study. The Academic Advising Inventory (AAI) was used to assess Academic Advising Style. For measuring level of the satisfaction, descriptive statistics was used. To compare the mean difference department-wise and gender-wise about academic advising satisfaction t.test was applied. It was concluded that from the major findings of the study those students who received departmental academic advising style are more satisfied as compared to those students who provided prescriptive academic advising style. Female students seemed more satisfied as compared to male students regarding the academic advising style provided to them. Students who satisfied from developmental academic advising style and they were also highly satisfied from the advising provided to them at Personalizing Education (PE) and this is the subscale of developmental academic advising whereas students who received prescriptive academic advising they were also satisfied from the advising provided to them regarding personalizing education and academic decision making but their percentage is less. It is recommended to Universities Administration to focus on Developmental Academic Advising Style and establish centers at universities/department level and nominate staff who may be responsible to provide developmental academic advising.

It happens almost everywhere i.e. at workplaces, public places or institutes as well. The focus of the present study was to explore the differences of male and female students\u2019 perception of sexual harassment. This study was a quantitative research. Sample of the study included of 400 students (200 males and 200 females) from two government and two private universities. In the present study, Sexual Harassment Perception Questionnaire (SHPQ) was used to find out these differences in perceptions as every person has his own view for different situations. The study revealed the significant differences in perception of students. Study showed that both genders perceived that female students get more harassed than male students. The factors that affect the perception frequently were gender and age. The findings recommended that regulations for sexual harassment should be implemented in universities; laws should be made for sexual harassment in higher education institutes. Students should be aware of sexual harassment through seminars, self-defense classes and awareness campaigns. And every institute should have a counseling center for the better mental health of students.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the \u2018Theory of the International Regimes\u2019. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (\u03b1= .91 to \u03b1=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

Courts were required to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to come to the Court. Nevertheless, it has some problems. The most important among them is the identification of the witness and an assurance that he is not being prompted when his statement is recorded.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre\u2019s idea of spatial triad and Soja\u2019s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie\u2019s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the \u2018status quo\u2019 and \u2018counter-hegemonic\u2019 states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d\u2018Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut\u2019s play \u2018Happy Birthday Wanda June\u2019 was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum. The play shows how toxic masculinity rooted in power and capitalism exploit both women and environment.

The Quran claims that it is a book which explains every situation; therefore, the aim of this study remained to extract those verses of Surah Al-Baqarah which can guide us in Economics. The authentic and approved Islamic clerics and their translations were consulted for the interpretations of the Holy verses. The researchers chiefly focused and studied Surah Baqarah with regards to social equity and economic opportunities.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The natives are majorly involved in illegal transportation of goods and objects, therefore; the study sets to explain how significant smuggling for the local people is. It describes the kinship role in reciprocity of their trade and transportation. The qualitative methods such as purposive sampling and interview guide were employed for data collection. The research findings revealed that local people were satisfied with their illegal trading which is depended largely on their expertise and know-how of smuggling at borders. They disclosed that their total economy was predominantly based on smuggling of stuff like drugs, diesel, oil, gas, petrol, ration food from Iran, and human trafficking. They also enjoyed the privilege of possessing Sajjil (Iranian identity card), thus; the dual nationality helped them in their daily business and rahdari (border crossing agreement), enabling them to travel to Iran for multiple purposes.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man\u2019s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe\u2019s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid\u2019s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser\u2019s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid\u2019s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government\u2019s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of \u2018grants on aid\u2019 to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries\u2019 autobiographies, Reports of missionaries\u2019 conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries\u2019 educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Daughters became curses and liability for parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society. To understand males\u2019 and females\u2019 perceptions about dowry; impacts of dowry; why dowry is essential; and how it is affecting women\u2019s rights and eventually affecting women\u2019s autonomy. A qualitative study was conducted. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews from males and females including social activists, economists, and married couples about wedding expenses, demands, society pressure, men\u2019s support, and perception against dowry especially with regards to women\u2019s rights and autonomy. The study concluded heavy dowry especially in terms of furniture, electronics, kitchenware, car, furnished houses, and cash highly associated with women\u2019s development and their rights. General people\u2019s perception showed that dowry is no longer remained a custom or tradition in Asian countries. It is just a trend and people follow it as a symbol of respect for parents and women as well.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government\u2019s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.

The model combines two key mechanisms that\nparticipate in ENSO dynamics: delayed negative feedback and seasonal forcing.\nWe perform stability analyses of the model in the three-dimensional space of\nits physically relevant parameters. Our results illustrate the role of these\nthree parameters: strength of seasonal forcing $b$, atmosphere-ocean coupling\n$\\kappa$, and propagation period $\\tau$ of oceanic waves across the Tropical\nPacific. Two regimes of variability, stable and unstable, are separated by a\nsharp neutral curve in the $(b,\\tau)$ plane at constant $\\kappa$. The detailed\nstructure of the neutral curve becomes very irregular and possibly fractal,\nwhile individual trajectories within the unstable region become highly complex\nand possibly chaotic, as the atmosphere-ocean coupling $\\kappa$ increases. In\nthe unstable regime, spontaneous transitions occur in the mean ``temperature''\n({\\it i.e.}, thermocline depth), period, and extreme annual values, for purely\nperiodic, seasonal forcing. The model reproduces the Devil's bleachers\ncharacterizing other ENSO models, such as nonlinear, coupled systems of partial\ndifferential equations; some of the features of this behavior have been\ndocumented in general circulation models, as well as in observations. We\nexpect, therefore, similar behavior in much more detailed and realistic models,\nwhere it is harder to describe its causes as completely.Comment: 22 pages, 9 figure"

If the outcome is positive, this test\ncan be used to suggest maximal superintegrability, whereas when the outcome is\nnegative it can be used to disprove it. This method can be regarded as a finite\ndimensional analog of the multiple scales method as a way to produce soliton\nequations. We use this technique to show that the real counterpart of a\nmechanical system found by Jules Drach in 1935 is, in general, not maximally\nsuperintegrable. We give some hints on how this approach could be applied to\nclassify maximally superintegrable systems by presenting a direct proof of the\nwell-known Bertrand's theorem.Comment: 30 pages, 4 figur"

This work builds on previous methods\nfor dispersive equations with constant coefficients, expanding the field to\ninclude a new class of equations which until now have eluded the time-evolving\nparameters. More precisely, throughout the Legendre-Petrov-Galerkin method we\nprove stability and convergence results of the approximation in appropriate\nweighted Sobolev spaces. These results allow to show the role and trade off of\nthese temporal parameters into the model. Afterwards, we numerically\ninvestigate the dispersion-dissipation relation for several profiles, further\nprovide insights into the implementation method, which allow to exhibit the\naccuracy and efficiency of our numerical algorithms."

The method is based on coupling the Monin-Obukov surface layer similarity profiles which include buoyant stability effects on mean velocity, temperature and humidity to a force-restore formulation for the evolution of surface soil temperature to yield the local values of shear stress, heat flux and surface temperature. A self-contained formulation is presented including parameterizations for solar and infrared radiant fluxes at the surface. Additional parameters needed to implement the scheme are the thermal heat capacity of the soil per unit surface area, surface aerodynamic roughness, latitude, solar declination, surface albedo,  surface emissivity and atmospheric transmissivity to solar radiation"

For all three problems, the two dimensional plate equations are reduced to one dimensional equations in the y-direction by using a one dimensional trigonometric approximation in the x-direction. Each problem uses different trigonometric terms. Solutions are obtained using an existing algorithm for simultaneous, first order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equations subject to two point boundary conditions. Ordinary differential equations are derived to determine the variable coefficients of the trigonometric terms"

In the case of weakly\nionized plasmas however, this can be inappropriate due to distinct responses\nfrom the multiple constituent species to both collisional and non-collisional\nforces. As a result, in dense molecular clouds and proto-stellar accretion\ndiscs for instance, the conductivity of the plasma may be highly anisotropic\nleading to phenomena such as Hall and ambipolar diffusion strongly influencing\nthe dynamics.\n  Diffusive processes are known to restrict the stability of conventional\nnumerical schemes which are not implicit in nature. Furthermore, recent work\nestablishes that a large Hall term can impose an additional severe stability\nlimit on standard explicit schemes. Following a previous paper which presented\nthe one-dimensional case, we describe a fully three-dimensional method which\nrelaxes the normal restrictions on explicit schemes for multifluid processes.\nThis is achieved by applying the little known Super TimeStepping technique to\nthe symmetric (ambipolar) component of the evolution operator for the magnetic\nfield in the local plasma rest-frame, and the new Hall Diffusion Scheme to the\nskew-symmetric (Hall) component.Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA"

        "abstract": "In this study, the Vlasov-Poisson equation with or without collision term for\nplasma is solved by the unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS). The Vlasov equation\nis a differential equation describing time evolution of the distribution\nfunction of plasma consisting of charged particles with long-range interaction.\nThe distribution function is discretized in discrete particle velocity space.\nAfter the Vlasov equation is integrated in finite volumes of physical space,\nthe numerical flux across a cell interface and source term for particle\nacceleration are computed to update the distribution function at next time\nstep. The flux is decided by Riemann problem and variation of distribution\nfunction in discrete particle velocity space is evaluated with central\ndifference method. A electron-ion collision model is introduced in the Vlasov\nequation. This finite volume method for the UGKS couples the free transport and\nlong-range interaction between particles. The electric field induced by charged\nparticles is controlled by the Poisson's equation. In this paper, the Poisson's\nequation is solved using the Green's function for two dimensional plasma system\nsubjected to the symmetry or periodic boundary conditions. Two numerical tests\nof the linear Landau damping and the Gaussian beam are carried out to validate\nthe proposed method. The linear electron plasma wave damping is simulated based\non electron-ion collision operator. Compared with previous methods, it is shown\nthat the current method is able to obtain accurate results of the\nVlasov-Poisson equation with a time step much larger than the particle\ncollision time. Highly non-equilibrium and rarefied plasma flows, such as\nelectron flows driven by electromagnetic field, can be simulated easily.Comment: 33 pages, 13 figure"

It consists of 20 papers carefully selected through a rigorous peer review. The first category of papers deals with the asymptotic and oscillatory behavior of solutions to various abstract differential equations and fractional differential equations. Periodic problems involving the scalar p-Laplacian equation on time scales, or n-species nonautonomous food chains with harvesting terms are studied using the Mawhin's continuation theorem. Some new oscillation criteria for the second-order quasilinear neutral delay dynamic equations and nonlinear delay dynamic equations on a time scale T, are established, improving some known results for oscillation of second-order nonlinear delay dynamic equations on time scales. The study of almost automorphic functions in Bochner's sense have attracted several mathematicians since the publication of N'Gu\u00e9r\u00e9kata's book in 2001. Recently, their applications to fractional differential equations have become an emerging field. A new and general existence and uniqueness theorem of almost automorphic solutions for the semilinear fractional differential equation in complex Banach spaces, with Stepanov-like almost automorphic coefficients is obtained, and applications to fractional relaxation-oscillation equations are presented. The method used here can be applied successfully to a large class of fractional differential equations. Another topic encountered in this issue is the existence of asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for a class of abstract partial neutral integrodifferential equations with"

Thus, aerodynamic detuning directly affects the fundamental driving mechanism for flutter. A model to demonstrate the enhanced supersonic aeroelastic stability associated with aerodynamic detuning is developed. The stability of an aerodynamically detuned cascade operating in a supersonic inlet flow field with a subsonic leading edge locus is analyzed, with the aerodynamic detuning accomplished by means of nonuniform circumferential spacing of adjacent rotor blades. The unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments on the blading are defined in terms of influence coefficients in a manner that permits the stability of both a conventional uniformally spaced rotor configuration as well as the detuned nonuniform circumferentially spaced rotor to be determined. With Verdon's uniformly spaced Cascade B as a baseline, this analysis is then utilized to demonstrate the potential enhanced aeroelastic stability associated with this particular type of aerodynamic detuning"

        "abstract": "Recently it was found that helical magnetized flows efficiently amplify\nAlfv\\'en waves (Rogava et al. 2003, A&A, v.399, p.421). This robust and\nmanifold nonmodal effect was found to involve regimes of transient algebraic\ngrowth (for purely ejectional flows), and exponential instabilities of both\nusual and parametric nature. However the study was made in the incompressible\nlimit and an important question remained open - whether this amplification is\ninherent to swirling MHD flows per se and what is the degree of its dependence\non the incompressibility condition. In this paper, in order to clear up this\nimportant question, we consider full compressible spectrum of MHD modes:\nAlfv\\'en waves (AW), slow magnetosonic waves (SMW) and fast magnetosonic waves\n(FMW). We find that helical flows inseparably blend these waves with each other\nand make them unstable, creating the efficient energy transfer from the mean\nflow to the waves. The possible role of these instabilities for the onset of\nthe MHD turbulence, self-heating of the flow and the overall dynamics of\nastrophysical flows are discussed.Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication (18.03.2003) in the\n  \"Astronomy and Astrophysics"

Anal. 2006]. At the weakly nonlinear level, the behavior of\nsurface waves is expected to be governed by an amplitude equation that can be\nderived by means of a formal asymptotic expansion. Amplitude equations for\nweakly nonlinear surface waves were introduced by Lardner [Int. J. Engng Sci.\n1983], Parker and co-workers [J. Elasticity 1985] in the framework of\nelasticity, and by Hunter [Contemp. Math. 1989] for abstract hyperbolic\nproblems. They consist of nonlocal evolution equations involving a complicated,\nbilinear Fourier multiplier in the direction of propagation along the boundary.\nIt was shown by the authors in an earlier work [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 2012]\nthat this multiplier, or kernel, inherits some algebraic properties from the\noriginal IBVP. These properties are crucial for the (local) well-posedness of\nthe amplitude equation, as shown together with Tzvetkov [Adv. Math., 2011].\nProperties of amplitude equations are revisited here in a somehow simpler way,\nfor surface waves in a variational setting. Applications include various\nphysical models, from elasticity of course to the director-field system for\nliquid crystals introduced by Saxton [Contemp. Math. 1989] and studied by\nAustria and Hunter [Commun. Inf. Syst. 2013]. Similar properties are eventually\nshown for the amplitude equation associated with surface waves at reversible\nphase boundaries in compressible fluids, thus completing a work initiated by\nBenzoni-Gavage and Rosini [Comput. Math. Appl. 2009]"

The instability is studied using three\nmethods: one based on the energy integral, which allows the determination of a\nsufficient condition of stability, one using a WKB approach, which allows the\ndetermination of the necessary and sufficient condition for instability and a\nlast one by numerical solution. This linear instability occurs in any inviscid\nstably stratified differential rotating fluid for rigid, stress-free or\nperiodic boundary conditions, provided the angular velocity $\\Omega$ decreases\noutwards with radius $r$. At not too small stratification, its growth rate is a\nfraction of $\\Omega$. The influence of viscous dissipation and thermal\ndiffusivity on the instability is studied numerically, with emphasis on the\ncase when $d \\ln \\Omega / d \\ln r =-3/2$ (Keplerian case). Strong\nstratification and large diffusivity are found to have a stabilizing effect.\nThe corresponding critical stratification and Reynolds number for the onset of\nthe instability in a typical disk are derived. We propose that the spontaneous\ngeneration of these linear modes is the source of turbulence in disks,\nespecially in weakly ionized disks.Comment: 19 pages, 13 figures, to appear in A&"

In the first part, mean-field\ntheory is presented, for both statics and dynamics, and its validity tested\nself-consistently. As is well known, the mean-field approximation breaks down\nbelow four spatial dimensions, where it can be replaced by a scaling\nphenomenology. The Ginzburg-Landau formalism can then be used to justify the\nphenomenological theory using the renormalization group, which elucidates the\nphysical and mathematical mechanism for universality. In the second part of the\npaper it is shown how near pattern forming linear instabilities of dynamical\nsystems, a formally similar Ginzburg-Landau theory can be derived for\nnonequilibrium macroscopic phenomena. The real and complex Ginzburg-Landau\nequations thus obtained yield nontrivial solutions of the original dynamical\nsystem, valid near the linear instability. Examples of such solutions are plane\nwaves, defects such as dislocations or spirals, and states of temporal or\nspatiotemporal (extensive) chaos"

We show that straight motion is unstable for the Hamburg test case and use numerical continuation and bifurcation software to compute a number of curves of states together with their stability, and the corresponding radii of the ship motion. In particular, straight forward motion can be stabilised by increasing the rudder size parameter, and the smallest possible radius is \u223c 119 m.\n\nThese analyses illustrate methods and tools from dynamical systems theory that can be used to analyse a model without simulation.

A general linear\ndispersion relation for partially ionized collisional plasmas including these\nmodes is derived and analyzed. For LAPD relevant profiles including strongly\ndriven flows it is found that all three modes can have comparable growth rates\nand frequencies. Detailed comparison with solutions of the analytic dispersion\nrelation demonstrates that BOUT accurately reproduces all characteristics of\nlinear modes in this system.Comment: Published in Physics of Plasmas, 17, 102107 (2010"

A zeroth approximation for the solution of the nonlinear equations, based on the mode shape corresponding to the first buckling pressure, is derived in closed form for each of the four types of pressure. The zeroth approximation is used to start the iteration cycle in Newton's method to compute numerical solutions of the nonlinear equations.

The proposed combined approach allows for the stability and time-response analysis of a constant non-delayed analog of the original periodic DDE by applying the LFT to an equivalent large-order system of time-periodic ordinary differential equations. The implementation issues are analyzed for the time-delayed Mathieu's equation which is used as an example. It is shown that an order reduction procedure in which only the dominant modes of the infinite-dimensional DDE are retained in the LFT is necessary. The application of the proposed technique is studied in the presence of delay and parametric resonances for the delayed Mathieu's equation, as well as for a double inverted pendulum subjected to a time-periodic retarded follower force."

There is a uniform steady state which, for certain values of the adjustable parameters, may be unstable. When the uniform solution is slightly unstable, the two-timing method is used to find the bifurcation of new solutions of small amplitude. These may be either nonuniform steady states or time-periodic solutions, depending on the ratio of the diffusion coefficients. When one of the parameters is allowed to depend on space and the basic state is unstable, it is found that the nonuniform steady state which is approached may show localized spatial oscillations. The localization arises out of the presence of turning points in the linearized stability equations"

As the Reynolds number Re = U0d/\u03bd is increased, the flow is shown to experience an original series of bifurcations leading to chaos. The range Re \u2208 [150, 218] is analysed in detail. In this range, five different non-axisymmetric regimes are successively encountered, including states similar to those previously identified in the flow past a sphere or an infinitely thin disk, as well as a new regime characterised by the presence of two distinct frequencies. A theoretical model based on the theory of mode interaction with symmetries, previously introduced to explain the bifurcations in the flow past a sphere or an infinitely thin disk (Fabre et al. in Phys Fluids 20:051702, 2008), is shown to explain correctly all these results. Higher values of the Reynolds number, up to 270, are also considered. Results indicate that the flow encounters at least four additional bifurcations before reaching a chaotic state"

Using a new coordinate system we find an ansatz for the solutions with\nonly one unknown function. We show that this function is independent of the\ncharge and our ansatz can therefore also be used to construct neutral black\nholes on cylinders and near-extremal charged dilatonic branes with a transverse\ncircle. For sufficiently large mass $M > M_c$ these solutions have a horizon\nthat connects across the cylinder but they are not translationally invariant\nalong the circle direction. We argue that the neutral solution has larger\nentropy than the neutral black string for any given mass. This means that for\n$M > M_c$ the neutral black string can gain entropy by redistributing its mass\nto a solution that breaks translational invariance along the circle, despite\nthe fact that it is classically stable. We furthermore explain how our\nconstruction can be used to study the thermodynamics of Little String Theory.Comment: latex, 68 pages, 4 figures. v2: Typos fixed, argument about \\chi\n  corrected in sec. 7.4, discussion of space of physical solutions corrected\n  and clarified in sec. 9; v3: v=\\pi clarified, typos fixed, figure 1 change"

        "abstract": "The Dirac equation for an electron in the central Coulomb field of a\npoint-like nucleus with the charge greater than 137 is considered. This\nsingular problem, to which the fall-down onto the centre is inherent, is\naddressed using a new approach, based on a black-hole concept of the singular\ncentre and capable of producing cut-off-free results. To this end the Dirac\nequation is presented as a generalized eigenvalue boundary problem of a\nself-adjoint operator. The eigenfunctions make complete sets, orthogonal with a\nsingular measure, and describe particles, asymptotically free and\ndelta-function-normalizable both at infinity and near the singular centre\n$r=0$. The barrier transmission coefficient for these particles responsible for\nthe effects of electron absorption and spontaneous electron-positron pair\nproduction is found analytically as a function of electron energy and charge of\nthe nucleus. The singular threshold behaviour of the corresponding amplitudes\nsubstitutes for the resonance behaviour, typical of the conventional theory,\nwhich appeals to a finite-size nucleus.Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures, LATEX requires IOPAR"

We investigate the transverse position of a train of bubbles,\nits velocity and the associated pressure drop when flowing in a microchannel\ndepending on the internal forces due to viscosity, inertia and capillarity.\nDespite the small scales of the system, inertia, referred to as inertial\nmigration force, play a crucial role in determining the transverse equilibrium\nposition of the bubbles. Beside inertia and viscosity, other effects may also\naffect the transverse migration of bubbles such as the Marangoni surface\nstresses and the surface deformability. We look at the influence of surfactants\nin the limit of infinite Marangoni effect which yields rigid bubble interface.\nThe resulting migration force may balance external body forces if present such\nas buoyancy, Dean or magnetic ones. This balance not only determines the\ntransverse position of the bubbles but, consequently, the surrounding flow\nstructure, which can be determinant for any mass/heat transfer process\ninvolved. Finally, we look at the influence of the bubble deformation on the\nequilibrium position and compare it to the inertial migration force at the\ncentred position, explaining the stable or unstable character of this position\naccordingly. A systematic study of the influence of the parameters - such as\nthe bubble size, uniform body force, Reynolds and capillary numbers - has been\ncarried out using numerical simulations based on the Finite Element Method,\nsolving the full steady Navier-Stokes equations and its asymptotic counterpart\nfor the limits of small Reynolds and/or capillary numbers.Comment: Submitted to JF"

These\nproperties are in sharp contrast with those of the ellipsoidal Birkhoff\nbilliards. Namely, generic complex invariant manifolds are not Abelian\nvarieties, and the billiard map is no more algebraic. A Poncelet-like theorem\nfor such system is known. We give explicit sufficient conditions both for\nclosed geodesics and periodic billiard orbits on Q and discuss their relation\nwith the elliptic KdV solutions and elliptic Calogero systemComment: 23 pages, Latex, 1 figure Postscrip"

Extensive numerical simulations of the\nCGLE reveal a wide range of dynamical zigzag behavior which we summarize in a\n`phase diagram'. We have performed a numerical linear stability and bifurcation\nanalysis of regular zigzag structures which reveals that traveling zigzags\nbifurcate from stationary zigzags via a pitchfork bifurcation. This bifurcation\nchanges from supercritical (forward) to subcritical (backward) as a function of\nthe CGLE coefficients, and we show the relevance of this for the `phase\ndiagram'. Our findings indicate that in the zigzag parameter regime of the\nCGLE, the transition between defect-rich and defect-poor states is governed by\nbifurcations of the zigzag structures.Comment: 20 pages, 11 figure"

We apply the recently introduced definition of periodicity for arbitrary isolated time scales to linear delay dynamic equations and a class of nonlinear delay dynamic equations. Utilizing a derived identity of higher order delta derivatives and delay terms, we rewrite the considered linear and nonlinear delayed dynamic equations with one\u2010periodic coefficients as a linear autonomous dynamic system with constant matrix. As the simplification of a constant matrix is only obtained for one\u2010periodic coefficients, dynamic equations with one\u2010periodic coefficients are the simplest form compared to the commonly used constant coefficients."

        "abstract": "The Faraday wave experiment is a classic example of a system driven by parametric forcing, and it produces a wide range of complex patterns, including superlattice patterns and quasipatterns. Nonlinear three-wave interactions between driven and weakly damped modes play a key role in determining which patterns are favored. We use this idea to design single and multifrequency forcing functions that produce examples of superlattice patterns and quasipatterns in a new model PDE with parametric forcing. We make quantitative comparisons between the predicted patterns and the solutions of the PDE. Unexpectedly, the agreement is good only for parameter values very close to onset. The reason that the range of validity is limited is that the theory requires strong damping of all modes apart from the driven pattern-forming modes. This is in conflict with the requirement for weak damping if three-wave coupling is to influence pattern selection effectively. We distinguish the two different ways that three-wave interactions can be used to stabilize quasipatterns, and we present examples of 12-, 14-, and 20-fold approximate quasipatterns. We identify which computational domains provide the most accurate approximations to 12-fold quasipatterns and systematically investigate the Fourier spectra of the most accurate approximations"

It is shown that the neutral\nsurface describing the onset of convection in the double-buoyancy case is\nessentially different from that of the well-studied purely thermal case, and\ndoes indeed allow the possibility of low-Rayleigh number convection. In\nparticular, isolated islands of instability are formed by an additional\n\"double-diffusive\" eigenmode in certain regions of the parameter space.\nHowever, the amplitude of such low-Rayleigh number convection is relatively\nweak. At similar flow amplitudes purely compositional and double-diffusive\ncases are characterized by a stronger time dependence compared to purely\nthermal cases, and by a prograde mean zonal flow near the inner cylindrical\nsurface. Implications of the results for planetary core convection are briefly\ndiscussed.Comment: Accepted for publication in Physics of the Earth and Planetary\n  Interiors on 20 April 201"

We consider optical and Zeeman potentials that are either in-phase\nor out-of-phase in two spinor components, respectively. The expectation value\nfor the position of the atom after one oscillation period of the linear force\nis recovered in authentic resonances or in pseudo-resonances. The frequencies\nof the linear force corresponding to authentic resonances are determined by the\nband structure of the periodic potential and are affected by the spin-orbit\ncoupling. The width/dispersion of the wavepacket in authentic resonances is\nusually minimal. The frequencies corresponding to pseudo-resonances do not\ndepend on the type of potential and on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling,\nwhile the evolution of excitations at the corresponding frequencies is usually\naccompanied by significant dispersion. Pseudo-resonances are determined by the\ninitial phase of the linear force and by the quasi-momentum of the wavepacket.\nDue to the spinor nature of the system, the motion of the atom is accompanied\nby periodic, but not harmonic, spin oscillations. Under the action of\nspin-orbit coupling the oscillations of the wavepacket can be nearly completely\nsuppressed in optical lattices. Dynamic localization in Zeeman lattices is\ncharacterized by doubling of the resonant oscillation periods due to band\ncrossing at the boundary of the Brillouin zone. We also show that higher\nharmonics in the Fourier expansion of the energy band lead to effective\ndispersion, which can be strong enough to prevent dynamic localization of the\nBloch wavepacket.Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures; accepted for Physical Review "

The vector fields for the nonautonomous systems are written as \u1e87 = a\u03a61(w) + b\u03a62(t,w), w \u2208 \u211d3, where a\u03a61 is the spacial part and b\u03a62 is the time-varying part, and a and b are real parameters. The first type has a polynomial as the nonlinear term, another type has a continuous periodic function as the nonlinear term. The polynomials and periodic functions have simple zeros. Several examples with numerical experiments are given. It is found by numerical calculation that there might exist only one attractor for the systems with polynomials as nonlinear terms and |b|\u226bmax{1,|a|}, and there might exist infinitely many attractors for systems with periodic functions as nonlinear terms and |b|\u226bmax{1,|a|}. For |b| sufficiently small, the parameter regions for (a,b) are roughly divided into three parts: the spacial region (|a|\u226b|b|), the balance region (|a|\u2248|b|), and the time-varying region (|a|\u226a|b|); (i) for |a|\u226b|b|, the orbits approach some planes depending on the zeros of the polynomials or the periodic functions; (ii) for |a|\u2248|b|, there exist attractors with the number no less than the number of zeros of the polynomials or the periodic functions, implying the existence of infinitely many attractors for systems with periodic functions as nonlinear terms; (iii) for |a|\u226a|b|, the orbits wind around some region depending on the choice of the initial position. The shape of the attractors might be strange or regular for different parameters, and we obtain the existence of ball-like (regular) attractors, two-wings (strange) attractors, and other attractors with different shapes. The Lyapunov exponents are negative. These results reveal an intrinsic relationship between the existence of attractors (or strange dynamics) and the parameters a and b for nonautonomous systems with quasi-periodic coefficients. These results will be very useful in the understanding of the dynamics of general nonautonomous systems, nonautonomous control theory and other related fields."

In effect, the hole flow along the cascade is described via scattering between quantized states belonging to neighboring periods, caused by phonons, alloy disorder, and carrier-carrier interactions.

The growth of clusters formed of small grains underpins a range of\nphenomena from the early stages of planetesimal formation to aerosols. However,\nthe collective effects of Coulomb forces on the nonequilibrium dynamics and\naggregation process in a granular gas -- a model representative of the above\nphysical processes -- have so far evaded theoretical scrutiny. Here, we\nestablish a hydrodynamic description of aggregating granular gases that\nexchange charges upon collisions and interact via the long-ranged Coulomb\nforces. We analytically derive the governing equations for the evolution of\ngranular temperature, charge variance, and number density for homogeneous and\nquasi-monodisperse aggregation. We find that, once the aggregates are formed,\nthe system obeys a physical constraint of nearly constant dimensionless ratio\nof characteristic electrostatic to kinetic energy $\\mathcal{B}(t)\\le 1$. This\nconstraint on the collective evolution of charged clusters is confirmed both by\nthe theory and the detailed molecular dynamics simulations. The inhomogeneous\naggregation of monomers and clusters in their mutual electrostatic field\nproceeds in a fractal manner. Our theoretical framework is extendable to more\nprecise charge exchange mechanism, a current focus of extensive\nexperimentation. Furthermore, it illustrates the collective role of long-ranged\ninteractions in dissipative gases and can lead to novel designing principles in\nparticulate systems"

The main attention is paid to study of asymptotical properties of equations with delay and systems of equations with delay. In the first chapter are given physical and technical examples described by differential equations with delay and their systems. The classification of equations with delay is given and basic notions of theory of stability are formulated (mainly with the emphasis on the Lyapunov second method). In the second chapter estimates of solutions of equations of neutral type are studied. The third chapter deals with systems of differential equations of neutral type. Asymptotic estimates for solutions and their derivatives are proved. At the end of the chapter examples and comparisons of our results and of other authors are given. The calculation were performed with the MATLAB software. Last, the fourth chapter deals with asymptotical properties of systems having a special type of nonlinearities, so called ``sector nonlinearities''. Properties and estimations of solutions and derivatives are derived. The basic tools used in the dissertation are the Lyapunov second method and functionals of Lyapunov-Krasovskii type."

We find that recovery of the correct expansion\nis an exact condition on the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy that is important for the\naccuracy of approximate kinetic energy functionals for atoms, molecules and\nsolids, when evaluated on a Kohn-Sham density. For example, this determines the\nsmall gradient limit of any generalized gradient approximation, and conflicts\nsomewhat with the standard gradient expansion. Tests are performed on atoms,\nmolecules, and jellium clusters. We also give a modern, highly accurate\nparametrization of the Thomas-Fermi density of neutral atoms.Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures, submitted at JC"

        "abstract": "Dynamical system models with delayed dynamics and small noise arise in a\nvariety of applications in science and engineering. In many applications,\nstable equilibrium or periodic behavior is critical to a well functioning\nsystem. Sufficient conditions for the stability of equilibrium points or\nperiodic orbits of certain deterministic dynamical systems with delayed\ndynamics are known and it is of interest to understand the sample path behavior\nof such systems under the addition of small noise. We consider a small noise\nstochastic delay differential equation (SDDE) with coefficients that depend on\nthe history of the process over a finite delay interval. We obtain asymptotic\nestimates, as the noise vanishes, on the time it takes a solution of the\nstochastic equation to exit a bounded domain that is attracted to a stable\nequilibrium point or periodic orbit of the corresponding deterministic\nequation. To obtain these asymptotics, we prove a sample path large deviation\nprinciple (LDP) for the SDDE that is uniform over initial conditions in bounded\nsets. The proof of the uniform sample path LDP uses a variational\nrepresentation for exponential functionals of strong solutions of the SDDE. We\nanticipate that the overall approach may be useful in proving uniform sample\npath LDPs for a broad class of infinite-dimensional small noise stochastic\nequations.Comment: 39 page"

In many applications,\nstable equilibrium or periodic behavior is critical to a well functioning\nsystem. Sufficient conditions for the stability of equilibrium points or\nperiodic orbits of certain deterministic dynamical systems with delayed\ndynamics are known and it is of interest to understand the sample path behavior\nof such systems under the addition of small noise. We consider a small noise\nstochastic delay differential equation (SDDE) with coefficients that depend on\nthe history of the process over a finite delay interval. We obtain asymptotic\nestimates, as the noise vanishes, on the time it takes a solution of the\nstochastic equation to exit a bounded domain that is attracted to a stable\nequilibrium point or periodic orbit of the corresponding deterministic\nequation. To obtain these asymptotics, we prove a sample path large deviation\nprinciple (LDP) for the SDDE that is uniform over initial conditions in bounded\nsets. The proof of the uniform sample path LDP uses a variational\nrepresentation for exponential functionals of strong solutions of the SDDE. We\nanticipate that the overall approach may be useful in proving uniform sample\npath LDPs for a broad class of infinite-dimensional small noise stochastic\nequations."

However, time-varying observation frequencies have not been considered. Particularly, an observational more efficient way is to consider the time-varying property of the system and observe a periodic SDE system at the periodic time-varying frequencies. This study investigates how to stabilise a periodic hybrid SDE by a periodic feedback control, based on periodic discrete-time observations. This study provides sufficient conditions under which the controlled system can achieve pth moment exponential stability for p > 1 and almost sure exponential stability. Lyapunov's method and inequalities are main tools for derivation and analysis. The existence of observation interval sequences is verified and one way of its calculation is provided. Finally, an example is given for illustration. Their new techniques not only reduce observational cost by reducing observation frequency dramatically but also offer flexibility on system observation settings. This study allows readers to set observation frequencies according to their needs to some extent"

Control of these interfacial\ninstabilities is relevant to a wide range of industrial applications including\ncoating processes and heat or mass transfer systems. This study considers the\neffect of blowing and suction through the substrate in order to construct from\nfirst principles physically realistic models that can be used for detailed\npassive and active control studies of direct relevance to possible experiments.\nTwo different long-wave, thin-film equations are derived to describe this\nsystem; these include the imposed blowing/suction as well as inertia, surface\ntension, gravity and viscosity. The case of spatially periodic blowing and\nsuction is considered in detail and the bifurcation structure of forced steady\nstates is explored numerically to predict that steady states cease to exist for\nsufficiently large suction speeds since the film locally thins to zero\nthickness giving way to dry patches on the substrate. The linear stability of\nthe resulting nonuniform steady states is investigated for perturbations of\narbitrary wavelengths, and any instabilities are followed into the fully\nnonlinear regime using time-dependent computations. The case of small amplitude\nblowing/suction is studied analytically both for steady states and their\nstability.

The key assumption -- proved in earlier numerical studies --\nis that the heterostructure can be treated as a weak perturbation with respect\nto some periodic reference crystal, with the nonlinear response small in\ncomparison to the linear response. Quadratic response theory is then used in\nconjunction with k.p perturbation theory to develop a multi-band effective-mass\nHamiltonian (for slowly varying envelope functions) in which all interface\nband-mixing effects are determined by the linear response. To within terms of\nthe same order as the position dependence of the effective mass, the quadratic\nresponse contributes only a bulk band offset term and an interface dipole term,\nboth of which are diagonal in the effective-mass Hamiltonian.

In distinct contrast to the\ndc-case, where the patterns are stationary and time-independent, they appear at\nfinite, small $\\omega$ periodically in time as sudden bursts. Flexodomains are\nin competition with the intensively studied electro-hydrodynamic instability in\nnematics, which presents a non-equilibrium dissipative transition. It will be\ndemonstrated that $\\omega$ is a very convenient control parameter to tune\nbetween flexodomains and convection patterns, which are clearly distinguished\nby the orientation of their stripes"

Making use of Floquet theory in the high frequency limit, we identify\na regime in which the system is accurately described by a Harper-Hofstadter\nmodel where the synthetic magnetic field can be externally tuned via the phase\nof the frequency-modulation of the different oscillators. We illustrate how the\ntopologically-protected chiral edge states, as well as the Hofstadter butterfly\nof bulk bands, can be observed in the driven-dissipative steady state under a\nmonochromatic drive. In analogy with the integer quantum Hall effect, we show\nhow the topological Chern numbers of the bands can be extracted from the mean\ntransverse shift of the steady-state oscillation amplitude distribution.\nFinally we discuss the regime where the analogy with the Harper-Hofstadter\nmodel breaks down.Comment: 15 pages, 9 figure"

In general, the existing results on asymptotic stability and boundedness of SFDEs require (i) the coefficients of the SFDEs obey the local Lipschitz condition and the linear growth condition; (ii) the diffusion operator of the SFDEs acting on a C2,1-function be bounded by a polynomial with the same order as the C2,1-function. However, there are many SFDEs which do not obey the linear growth condition. Moreover, for such highly nonlinear SFDEs, the diffusion operator acting on a C2,1-function is generally bounded by a polynomial with a higher order than the C2,1-function. Hence the existing criteria on stability and boundedness for SFDEs are not applicable andwesee the necessity to develop new criteria. Our main aim in this paper is to establish new criteria where the linear growth condition is no longer needed while the up-bound for the diffusion operator may take a much more general form"

        "abstract": "It is well known that any cyclic solution of a spin 1/2 neutral particle\nmoving in an arbitrary magnetic field has a nonadiabatic geometric phase\nproportional to the solid angle subtended by the trace of the spin. For neutral\nparticles with higher spin, this is true for cyclic solutions with special\ninitial conditions. For more general cyclic solutions, however, this does not\nhold. As an example, we consider the most general solutions of such particles\nmoving in a rotating magnetic field. If the parameters of the system are\nappropriately chosen, all solutions are cyclic. The nonadiabatic geometric\nphase and the solid angle are both calculated explicitly. It turns out that the\nnonadiabatic geometric phase contains an extra term in addition to the one\nproportional to the solid angle. The extra term vanishes automatically for spin\n1/2. For higher spin, however, it depends on the initial condition. We also\nconsider the valence electron of an alkaline atom. For cyclic solutions with\nspecial initial conditions in an arbitrary strong magnetic field, we prove that\nthe nonadiabatic geometric phase is a linear combination of the two solid\nangles subtended by the traces of the orbit and spin angular momenta. For more\ngeneral cyclic solutions in a strong rotating magnetic field, the nonadiabatic\ngeometric phase also contains extra terms in addition to the linear\ncombination.Comment: revtex, 18 pages, no figur"

        "abstract": "Magnetorotational dynamo action in Keplerian shear flow is a three-dimensional, non-linear magnetohydrodynamic process whose study is relevant to the understanding of accretion processes and magnetic field generation in astrophysics. Transition to this form of dynamo action is subcritical and shares many characteristics of transition to turbulence in non-rotating hydrodynamic shear flows. This suggests that these different fluid systems become active through similar generic bifurcation mechanisms, which in both cases have eluded detailed understanding so far. In this paper, we build on recent work on the two problems to investigate numerically the bifurcation mechanisms at work in the incompressible Keplerian magnetorotational dynamo problem in the shearing box framework. Using numerical techniques imported from dynamical systems research, we show that the onset of chaotic dynamo action at magnetic Prandtl numbers larger than unity is primarily associated with global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations of nonlinear magnetorotational dynamo cycles. These global bifurcations are found to be supplemented by local bifurcations of cycles marking the beginning of period-doubling cascades. The results suggest that nonlinear magnetorotational dynamo cycles provide the pathway to turbulent injection of both kinetic and magnetic energy in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic Keplerian shear flow in the absence of an externally imposed magnetic field. Studying the nonlinear physics and bifurcations of these cycles in different regimes and configurations may subsequently help to better understand the physical conditions of excitation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and instability-driven dynamos in a variety of astrophysical systems and laboratory experiments. The detailed characterization of global bifurcations provided for this three-dimensional subcritical fluid dynamics problem may also prove useful for the problem of transition to turbulence in hydrodynamic shear flows"

        "abstract": "The effects of a spatially periodic forcing on an oscillating chemical\nreaction as described by the Lengyel-Epstein model are investigated. We find a\nsurprising competition between two oscillating patterns, where one is harmonic\nand the other subharmonic with respect to the spatially periodic forcing. The\noccurrence of a subharmonic pattern is remarkable as well as its preference up\nto rather large values of the modulation amplitude. For small modulation\namplitudes we derive from the model system a generic equation for the envelope\nof the oscillating reaction that includes an additional forcing contribution,\ncompared to the amplitude equations known from previous studies in other\nsystems. The analysis of this amplitude equation allows the derivation of\nanalytical expressions even for the forcing corrections to the threshold and to\nthe oscillation frequency, which are in a wide range of parameters in good\nagreement with the numerical analysis of the complete reaction equations. In\nthe nonlinear regime beyond threshold, the subharmonic solutions exist in a\nfinite range of the control parameter that has been determined by solving the\nreaction equations numerically for various sets of parameters.Comment: 14 pages, 11 figure"

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the heating of the magnetized solar chromosphere\ninduced by the large fraction of neutral atoms present in this layer. The\npresence of neutrals, together with the decrease with height of the collisional\ncoupling, leads to deviations from the classical MHD behavior of the\nchromospheric plasma. A relative net motion appears between the neutral and\nionized components, usually referred to as ambipolar diffusion. The dissipation\nof currents in the chromosphere is enhanced orders of magnitude due to the\naction of ambipolar diffusion, as compared to the standard ohmic diffusion. We\npropose that a significant amount of magnetic energy can be released to the\nchromosphere just by existing force-free 10--40 G magnetic fields there. As a\nconsequence, we conclude that ambipolar diffusion is an important process that\nshould be included in chromospheric heating models, as it has the potential to\nrapidly heat the chromosphere. We perform analytical estimations and numerical\nsimulations to prove this idea.Comment: Accepted for publication by The Astrophysical Journa"

These so called 'Nozaki-Bekki holes'\nare (dynamically) stable in some parameter range, but always structually\nunstable: A perturbation of the equation in general leads to a (positive or\nnegative) monotonic acceleration or an oscillation of the holes. This confirms\nthat the cubic CGLE has an inner symmetry. As a consequence small perturbations\nchange some of the qualitative dynamics of the cubic CGLE and enhance or\nsuppress spatio-temporal intermittency in some parameter range. An analytic\nstability analysis of holes in the cubic CGLE and a semianalytical treatment of\nthe acceleration instability in the perturbed equation is performed by using\nmatching and perturbation methods. Furthermore we treat the asymptotic\nhole-shock interaction.

The microscopic setting is a\ntwo-component periodic composite consisting of a dilute electrolyte continuum\n(described by standard PNP equations) and a continuous dielectric matrix, which\nis impermeable to the ions and carries a given surface charge. Four new\nfeatures arise in the upscaled equations: (i) the effective ionic diffusivities\nand mobilities become tensors, related to the microstructure; (ii) the\neffective permittivity is also a tensor, depending on the electrolyte/matrix\npermittivity ratio and the ratio of the Debye screening length to the\nmacroscopic length of the porous medium; (iii) the microscopic fluidic\nconvection is replaced by a diffusion-dispersion correction in the effective\ndiffusion tensor; and (iv) the surface charge per volume appears as a\ncontinuous \"background charge density\", as in classical membrane models. The\ncoefficient tensors in the upscaled PNP equations can be calculated from\nperiodic reference cell problems. For an insulating solid matrix, all gradients\nare corrected by the same tensor, and the Einstein relation holds at the\nmacroscopic scale, which is not generally the case for a polarizable matrix,\nunless the permittivity and electric field are suitably defined. In the limit\nof thin double layers, Poisson's equation is replaced by macroscopic\nelectroneutrality (balancing ionic and surface charges). The general form of\nthe macroscopic PNP equations may also hold for concentrated solution theories,\nbased on the local-density and mean-field approximations. These results have\nbroad applicability to ion transport in porous electrodes, separators,\nmembranes, ion-exchange resins, soils, porous rocks, and biological tissues"

A previously-reported\nspectral method is used which relies on a Galerkin expansion in\nChandrasekhar-Kendall vector eigenfunctions of the curl. The new ingredient in\nthis set of computations is the rigid rotation of the sphere. After a few\npurely hydrodynamic examples are sampled (spin down, Ekman pumping, inertial\nwaves), attention is focused on selective decay and the MHD dynamo problem. In\ndynamo runs, prescribed mechanical forcing excites a persistent velocity field,\nusually turbulent at modest Reynolds numbers, which in turn amplifies a small\nseed magnetic field that is introduced. A wide variety of dynamo activity is\nobserved, all at unit magnetic Prandtl number. The code lacks the resolution to\nprobe high Reynolds numbers, but nevertheless interesting dynamo regimes turn\nout to be plentiful in those parts of parameter space in which the code is\naccurate. The key control parameters seem to be mechanical and magnetic\nReynolds numbers, the Rossby and Ekman numbers (which in our computations are\nvaried mostly by varying the rate of rotation of the sphere) and the amount of\nmechanical helicity injected. Magnetic energy levels and magnetic dipole\nbehavior are exhibited which fluctuate strongly on a time scale of a few eddy\nturnover times. These seem to stabilize as the rotation rate is increased until\nthe limit of the code resolution is reached.Comment: 26 pages, 17 figures, submitted to New Journal of Physic"

A small amount of noise can make the\nrecovery unstable, and nonlinearity and differential equations with varying\ncoefficients add complexity to the problem. We assume that the governing\npartial differential equation (PDE) is a linear combination of a subset of a\nprescribed dictionary containing different differential terms, and the\nobjective of this paper is to find the correct coefficients.\n  We propose a new direction based on the fundamental idea of convergence\nanalysis of numerical PDE schemes. We utilize Lasso for efficiency, and a\nperformance guarantee is established based on an incoherence property. The main\ncontribution is to validate and correct the results by Time Evolution Error\n(TEE). The new algorithm, called Identifying Differential Equations with\nNumerical Time evolution (IDENT), is explored for data with non-periodic\nboundary conditions, noisy data and PDEs with varying coefficients. From the\nrecovery analysis of Lasso, we propose a new definition of Noise-to-Signal\nratio, which better represents the level of noise in the case of PDE\nidentification. We systematically analyze the effects of data generations and\ndownsampling, and propose an order preserving denoising method called\nLeast-Squares Moving Average (LSMA), to preprocess the given data. For the\nidentification of PDEs with varying coefficients, we propose to add Base\nElement Expansion (BEE) to aide the computation. Various numerical experiments\nfrom basic tests to noisy data, downsampling effects and varying coefficients\nare presented."

The simplest flow where this type of instability can occur is that due to the torsional oscillations of an infinitely long circular cylinder. For more complicated spatially varying time-periodic flows, a similar type of instability can occur and is spatially localized near the most unstable positions. When nonlinear effects are considered it is found that the instability modifies the steady streaming boundary layer induced by the oscillatory motion. It is shown that a rapidly rotating cylinder in a uniform flow is susceptible to a related type of instability; the appropriate stability equations are shown to be identical to those which govern the instability of a boussinesq fluid of Prandtl number unity heated time periodically from below"

        "abstract": "In the present report the stability of two-dimensional laminar flows of a gas is investigated by the method of small perturbations. The chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layer. \n\n\n\nPart I of the present report deals with the general mathematical theory. The general equations governing one normal mode of the small velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great detail. It is found that for Reynolds numbers of the order of those encountered in most aerodymnic problems, the temperature disturbances have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (\"viscous solutions\"). Indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first\n\napproximation. Because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is greatly simplified. The final equation determining the characteristic values of the stability problem depends on the \"inviscid solutions\" and the function of Tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the incompressible fluid. The second viscosity coefficient and the coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem; only the ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved. \n\n\n\nPart II deals wlth the limiting case of infinite Reynolds numbers. The study of energy relations is very much emphasized. It is shown that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface has a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer. \n\n\n\nA general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the Rayleigh-Tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid. If this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the main flow exceeding 1 - 1/M (where M is the free stream Mach number), then neutral and self-excited \"subsonic\" disturbances exist in the inviscid fluid. (The subsonic disturbances die out rapidly with distance from the solid surface.) The conditions for the existence of other types of disturbance have not yet been established to this extent of exactness. A formula has been worked out to give the amplitude ratio of incoming and reflected sound waves. \n\n\n\nIt is found in the present investigation that when the solid boundary is heated, the boundary layer flow is destabilized through the change in the distribution of the product of density and vorticity, but stabilized through the increase of kinematic viscosity near the solid boundary. When the solid boundary is cooled, the situation is just the reverse. The actual extent to which these two effects counteract each\n\nother can only be settled by actual computation or some approximate estimstes of the minimum critical Reylolds number. This question will be investigated in a subsequent report. \n\n\n\nPart III deals with the stability of laminar flows in a perfect gas with the effect of viscosity included. The method for the numerical computation of the stability limit is outlined; detailed numerical calculations will be carried out in a subsequent report"

        "abstract": "Genotypic variation, environmental variation, and their interaction may produce variation in the developmental process and cause phenotypic differences among individuals. Developmental noise, which arises during development from stochasticity in cellular and molecular processes when genotype and environment are fixed, also contributes to phenotypic variation. While evolutionary biology has long focused on teasing apart the relative contribution of genes and environment to phenotypic variation, our understanding of the role of developmental noise has lagged due to technical difficulties in directly measuring the contribution of developmental noise. The influence of developmental noise is likely underestimated in studies of phenotypic variation due to intrinsic mechanisms within organisms that stabilize phenotypes and decrease variation. Since we are just beginning to appreciate the extent to which phenotypic variation due to stochasticity is potentially adaptive, the contribution of developmental noise to phenotypic variation must be separated and measured to fully understand its role in evolution. Here, we show that variation in the component of the developmental process corresponding to environmental and genetic factors (here treated together as a unit called the LALI-type) versus the contribution of developmental noise, can be distinguished for leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) head color patterns using mathematical simulations that model the role of random variation (corresponding to developmental noise) in patterning. Specifically, we modified the parameters of simulations corresponding to variation in the LALI-type to generate the full range of phenotypic variation in color pattern seen on the heads of eight leopard geckos. We observed that over the range of these parameters, variation in color pattern due to LALI-type variation exceeds that due to developmental noise in the studied gecko cohort. However, the effect of developmental noise on patterning is also substantial. Our approach addresses one of the major goals of evolutionary biology: to quantify the role of stochasticity in shaping phenotypic variation"

The existing method for delay differential equations uses a Lie-B\u00e4cklund operator and an Invariant Manifold Theorem to define the operators which are used to obtain the infinitesimal generators of the Lie group. In this paper, we adopt a different approach and use Taylor\u2019s theorem to obtain a Lie type invariance condition and the determining equations for a neutral differential equation. We then split this equation in a manner similar to that of ordinary differential equations to obtain an over-determined system of partial differential equations. These equations are then solved to obtain corresponding infinitesimals, and hence desired equivalent symmetries. We then obtain the symmetry algebra admitted by this neutral differential equation.

Epstein [2] has shown that if A (t) is periodic and odd then all solutions of (1) are periodic. Also, using formulae from differential geometry, Epstein obtained a necessary condition that all solutions of (1) be periodic provided that A (t) is 3 X 3, skew symmetric, and periodic. We show that if A(t) is skew symmetric and periodic, then every solution of (1) is almost periodic. This theorem is important for two reasons. First, it is of interest in itself. Second, Epstein has shown that the solutions of (1) depend on those of two systems, one of which is symmetric and the other skew symmetric. The coefficients of the symmetric system will be periodic if the solutions of the skew symmetric system are periodic with the same period as the original system. Since the fundamental solution matrix of (1) can be expressed as X(t) =P(t) Y(t) where P(t) is periodic and Y(t) =exp Dt is the fundamental solution matrix of Y' = D Y with D constant, one would be reluctant to use Epstein's technique of separating (1) into two systems unless he could be sure that both of the resulting systems would have solutions of a correspondingly simple form as that of (1). Our theorem enables us to show that the fundamental solution matrix of the symmetric system can be expressed as F(t) exp Dt where F(t) is almost periodic and D is constant."

When $\\mu=0$, the problem admits orbits for the massless particle that\nare ellipses of eccentricity $e$ with the primary of mass 1 located at one of\nthe focii. If the period is a rational multiple of $2\\pi$, denoted $2\\pi p/q$,\nsome of these orbits perturb to periodic motions for $\\mu > 0$. For typical\nvalues of $e$ and $p/q$, two resonant periodic motions are obtained for $\\mu >\n0$. We show that the characteristic multipliers of both these motions are given\nby expressions of the form $1\\pm\\sqrt{C(e,p,q)\\mu}+O(\\mu)$ in the limit $\\mu\\to\n0$. The coefficient $C(e,p,q)$ is analytic in $e$ at $e=0$ and\n$C(e,p,q)=O(e^{\\abs{p-q}})$. The coefficients in front of $e^{\\abs{p-q}}$,\nobtained when $C(e,p,q)$ is expanded in powers of $e$ for the two resonant\nperiodic motions, sum to zero. Typically, if one of the two resonant periodic\nmotions is of elliptic type the other is of hyperbolic type. We give similar\nresults for retrograde periodic motions and discuss periodic motions that\nnearly collide with the primary of mass $1-\\mu$."

Sample flows from five families are used to demonstrate numerically\nthat neither zero kinetic helicity density, nor zero helicity spectrum prohibit\ngeneration of large-scale magnetic field by the two most prominent dynamo\nmechanisms: the magnetic $\\alpha$-effect and negative eddy diffusivity. Our\ncomputations also attest that such flows often generate small-scale field for\nsufficiently small magnetic molecular diffusivity.

The conference was organised by Brunel University and supported by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, IPEM, the Italian Union of Thermofluid dynamics, the Process Intensification Network, HEXAG - the Heat Exchange Action Group and the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.The goal of any cancer therapy is to achieve efficient, tissue-specific targeting of drugs to cancer cells. However, most anticancer agents act on healthy and malignant tissue alike, potentially resulting in side effects to healthy tissue. This has motivated the development of treatment strategies that are cancer-cell\r\nspecific; one approach uses biomimetic polymer vesicles (BPV) to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs into cells before releasing them. BPVs are synthetic membrane enclosed, nanometre-sized structures, and provide ideal drug delivery vectors because specific targeting to cancer cells can be achieved by coating with tumourspecific\r\nmolecules. We present several mathematical models covering a wide range of length-scales pertinent to BPV-mediated delivery protocols and focus on capturing the in vivo environment by evaluating the impact of the underlying vascular structure upon the governing transport mechanisms. Firstly, we present models of specific binding of BPVs to cancer cells. Subsequently we examine the implications of these model outputs in the contexts of both discrete capillary architectures and higher level homogenized-models that track blood and BPV transport at the tissue scale (both intra- and extra-tumorally). Numerical solutions are discussed, and recommendations are presented on that optimal integration of the models to generate quantitative predictions associated with BPV treatment efficacy"

Fluids 11, 1245 (1968)] as a model of the dynamo effect is thoroughly studied in the limit of large magnetic Prandtl number. The focus is on two types of localized solutions involving shocks (antishocks) and hollow (bump) waves. Numerical simulations suggest phenomenological rules concerning their generation, stability and basin of attraction. Their topology, amplitude and thickness are compared favourably with those of the meromorphic travelling waves, which are obtained exactly, and respectively those of asymptotic descriptions involving rational or degenerate elliptic functions. The meromorphy bars the existence of certain configurations, while others are explained by assuming imaginary residues. These explanations are tested using the numerical amplitude and phase of the Fourier transforms as probes of the analyticity properties. Theoretically, the proof of the partial integrability backs up the role ascribed to meromorphy. Practically, predictions are derived for MHD plasmas"

The so-called\ncell problem of homogenization theory is solved and an explicit expression is\ngiven for the macroscopic dielectric constant in a form akin to the\nClausius-Mossotti or Lorentz-Lorenz relation. The validity of this expression\nis checked by showing that the macroscopic dielectric constant is causal and\nhas the expected symmetry properties, and that the average of the microscopic\nenergy density is the macroscopic one.

        "abstract": "The onset and development of both dynamically and convectively forced boundary layer rolls are studied with linear and nonlinear analyses of a truncated spectral model of shallow Boussinesq flow. Emphasis is given here on the energetics of the dominant roll modes, on the magnitudes of the roll-induced modifications of the initial basic state wind and temperature profiles, and on the sensitivity of the linear stability results to the use of modified profiles as basic states. It is demonstrated that the roll circulations can produce substantial changes to the cross-roll component of the initial wind profile and that significant changes in orientation angle estimates can result from use of a roll-modified profile in the stability analysis. These results demonstrate that roll contributions must be removed from observed background wind profiles before using them to investigate the mechanisms underlying actual secondary flows in the boundary layer. The model is developed quite generally to accept arbitrary basic state wind profiles as dynamic forcing. An Ekman profile is chosen here merely to provide a means for easy comparison with other theoretical boundary layer studies; the ultimate application of the model is to study observed boundary layer profiles. Results of the analytic stability analysis are validated by comparing them with results from a larger linear model. For an appropriate Ekman depth, a complete set of transition curves is given in forcing parameter space for roll modes driven both thermally and dynamically. Preferred orientation angles, horizontal wavelengths and propagation frequencies, as well as energetics and wind profile modifications, are all shown to agree rather well with results from studies on Ekman layers as well as with studies on near-neutral and convective atmospheric boundary layers"

We show analytically that the former,\napplied for the evaluation of magnetic eddy diffusivities, yields results that\nfully agree with the latter. Our computations of the magnetic eddy diffusivity\ntensor for the specific instances of the parity-invariant flow-IV of G.O.\nRoberts and the modified Taylor-Green flow in a suitable range of parameter\nvalues confirm the findings of previous studies, and also explain some of their\napparent contradictions. The two flows have large symmetry groups; this is used\nto considerably simplify the eddy diffusivity tensor. Finally, a new analytic\nresult is presented: upon expressing the eddy diffusivity tensor in terms of\nsolutions to auxiliary problems for the adjoint operator, we derive relations\nbetween magnetic eddy diffusivity tensors that arise for opposite small-scale\nflows v(x) and -v(x).Comment: 29 pp., 19 figures, 42 reference"

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a model that explains the prepatterning of lymphatic vessel morphology in collagen gels. This model is derived using the theory of two phase rubber material due to Flory and coworkers and it consists of two coupled fourth order partial differential equations describing the evolution of the collagen volume fraction, and the evolution of the proton concentration in a collagen implant; as described in experiments of Boardman and Swartz (Circ. Res. 92, 801\u2013808, 2003). Using linear stability analysis, we find that above a critical level of proton concentration, spatial patterns form due to small perturbations in the initially uniform steady state. Using a long wavelength reduction, we can reduce the two coupled partial differential equations to one fourth order equation that is very similar to the Cahn\u2013Hilliard equation; however, it has more complex nonlinearities and degeneracies. We present the results of numerical simulations and discuss the biological implications of our model"

        "abstract": "In a hypersonic boundary layer over a wall of variable curvature, the region most susceptible to Goertler vortices is the temperature adjustment layer over which the basic state temperature decreases monotonically to its free stream value. Except for a special wall curvature distribution, the evolution of Goertler vortices trapped in the temperature adjustment layer will in general be strongly affected by the boundary layer growth through the O(M sup 3/2) curvature of the basic state, where M is the free stream Mach number. Only when the local wavenumber becomes as large as of order M sup 3/8, do nonparallel effects become negligible in the determination of stability properties. In the latter case, Goertler vortices will be trapped in a thin layer of O(epsilon sup 1/2) thickness which is embedded in the temperature adjustment layer; here epsilon is the inverse of the local wavenumber. A weakly nonlinear theory is presented in which the initial nonlinear development of Goertler vortices in the neighborhood of the neutral position is studied and two coupled evolution equations are derived. From these, it can be determined whether the vortices are decaying or growing depending on the sign of a constant which is related to wall curvature and the basic state temperature"

More\nprecisely, we show that this function $u_s$ fulfills equations of the form\n{equation*}\n\\big(u_s^{(\\alpha)}u_s^{(\\beta)}\\big)(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{2+\\alpha+\\beta}b_{\\alpha,\\beta}(n)u_s^{(n)}(x)+c_{\\alpha,\\beta},\n{equation*} for any $s>0$ and for all $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\N_0$. We give explicit\nexpressions for the coefficients $b_{\\alpha,\\beta}(n)$ and $c_{\\alpha,\\beta}$\nfor given $s$.\n  Moreover, we show that for any $s$ satisfying $\\sinh(\\pi/(2s))\\geq 1$ the set\nof functions $\\{1,u^{\\vphantom{a}}_s,u'_s,u\"_s,...\\}$ constitutes a basis for\n$L^2(0,2\\pi)$. By virtue of our formulas the problem of finding a periodic\nsolution to any nonlinear wave equation reduces to a problem in the\ncoefficients. A finite ansatz exactly solves the KdV equation (giving the\nwell-known cnoidal wave solution) and the Kawahara equation. An infinite ansatz\nis expected to be especially efficient if the equation to be solved can be\nconsidered a perturbation of the KdV equation."

In\nparticular, we resolve the long-standing question of nonlinear modulational\nstability by demonstrating that spectrally stable waves are nonlinearly stable\nwhen subject to small localized (integrable) perturbations. Our analysis is\nbased upon detailed estimates of the linearized solution operator, which are\ncomplicated by the fact that the (necessarily essential) spectrum of the\nassociated linearization intersects the imaginary axis at the origin. We carry\nout a numerical Evans function study of the spectral problem and find bands of\nspectrally stable periodic traveling waves, in close agreement with previous\nnumerical studies of Frisch-She-Thual, Bar-Nepomnyashchy,\nChang-Demekhin-Kopelevich, and others carried out by other techniques. We also\ncompare predictions of the associated Whitham modulation equations, which\nformally describe the dynamics of weak large scale perturbations of a periodic\nwave train, with numerical time evolution studies, demonstrating their\neffectiveness at a practical level. For the reader's convenience, we include in\nan appendix the corresponding treatment of the Swift-Hohenberg equation, a\nnonconservative counterpart of the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation\nfor which the nonlinear stability analysis is considerably simpler, together\nwith numerical Evans function analyses extending spectral stability analyses of\nMielke and Schneider.Comment: 78 pages, 11 figure"

We focus on calculating the electrophoretic\nmobility in the limit of small driving field, and systematically linearise the\nequations with respect to the latter. This gives rise to several subproblems,\neach of which is solved by a specialised numerical algorithm. For the total\nproblem we combine these solvers in an iterative procedure. Applying this\nmethod, we study the effect of the screening mechanism (salt screening vs.\ncounterion screening) on the electrophoretic mobility, and find a weak\nnon-trivial dependence, as expected from scaling theory. Furthermore, we find\nthat the orientation of the charge cloud (i. e. its dipole moment) depends on\nthe value of the colloid charge, as a result of a competition between\nelectrostatic and hydrodynamic effects.Comment: accepted for publication in Journal of Physics Condensed Matter\n  (proceedings of the 2012 CODEF conference"

In this work, spatial heterogeneity is introduced via\ncoupled map lattices (CML) and partial differential equations. Stability and\npersistence of some realistic CML are discussed. Chaos control, synchronization\nand persistence are studied for some CML. Some applications in population\nbiology and ecology are given. A simple method for finding the sufficient\nconditions for the existence of periodic solutions for differential equations\nwith periodic coefficients is given.

For subspaces $M^n(t)$ and\n$M^{n-m}(t)$ which are invariant manifolds of the differential equation under\nconsideration we build a change of variables which splits this equation into a\nsystem of two independent equations. A notion of equivalence of linear\ndifferential equations of different orders is introduced. Necessary and\nsufficient conditions of this equivalence are given. These results are applied\nto the Flocke-Lyapunov theory for linear equations with periodic coefficients\nwith a period T. In the case when monodromy matrix of the equation has negative\neigenvalues, thus reduction in $R^m$ to an equation with constant coeficcients\nis possible only with doubling of reduction matrix period, we prove the\npossibility of splitting off in $R^m$ of equations with negative eigenvalues of\nmonodromy matrix with the help of a real matrix without period doubling. For\nthe fundamental matrix of solutions of an equation with periodic coefficients\n$X(t), X(t)=E$, we find representation $X(t)=\\Phi(t)e^{Ht}\\Phi^{+}(0)$ with\nreal rectangular matrices $H$ and $\\Phi(t), \\Phi(t)=\\Phi(t+T)$. We bring two\napplications of these results: 1) reduction of nonlinear differential equation\nin $R^n$ with distinguished linear part which is periodic with period T to the\nequation in $R^m, m>n$, with a constiant matrix of coefficients of the linear\npart; 2) for introdusing of amplitude-phase coordinates in the neigbourhood of\nperiodic orbit of autonomous differential equation with separation of the\nlinear part with constant matrix of coefficients."

The case is considered in which the secondary mode could be satisfactorily described by a linear stability theory and herein the objective is to extend this investigation of Hall and Seddougui (1989) into the nonlinear regime. It was found that at this stage not only does the secondary mode become nonlinear but it also interacts with itself so as to modify the governing equations for the primary Goertler vortex. In this case then, the vortex and the travelling wave drive each other and, indeed, the whole flow structure is described by an infinite set of coupled, nonlinear differential equations. A Stuart-Watson type of weakly nonlinear analysis of these equations is undertaken and concluded, in particular, that on this basis there exist stable flow configurations in which the travelling mode is of finite amplitude. Implications of the findings for practical situations are discussed and it is shown that the theoretical conclusions drawn here are in good qualitative agreement with available experimental observations"

        "abstract": "The stability of a high-speed, axisymmetric boundary layer is investigated using secondary instability theory and direct numerical simulation. Parametric studies based on the temporal secondary instability theory identify subharmonic secondary instability as a likely path to transition on a cylinder at Mach 4.5. The theoretical predictions are validated by direct numerical simulation at temporally-evolving primary and secondary disturbances in an axisymmetric boundary-layer flow. At small amplitudes of the secondary disturbance, predicted growth rates agree to several significant digits with values obtained from the spectrally-accurate solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Qualitative agreement persists to large amplitudes of the secondary disturbance. Moderate transverse curvature is shown to significantly affect the growth rate of axisymmetric second mode disturbances, the likely candidates of primary instability. The influence of curvature on secondary instability is largely indirect but most probably significant, through modulation of the primary disturbance amplitude. Subharmonic secondary instability is shown to be predominantly inviscid in nature, and to account for spikes in the Reynolds stress components at or near the critical layer"

        "abstract": "The nonlinear evolution of a pair of initially oblique waves in a high Reynolds Number Stokes layer is studied. Attention is focused on times when disturbances of amplitude epsilon have O(epsilon(exp 1/3)R) growth rates, where R is the Reynolds number. The development of a pair of oblique waves is then controlled by nonlinear critical-layer effects. Viscous effects are included by studying the distinguished scaling epsilon = O(R(exp -1)). This leads to a complicated modification of the kernel function in the integro-differential amplitude equation. When viscosity is not too large, solutions to the amplitude equation develop a finite-time singularity, indicating that an explosive growth can be introduced by nonlinear effects; we suggest that such explosive growth can lead to the bursts observed in experiments. Increasing the importance of viscosity generally delays the occurrence of the finite-time singularity, and sufficiently large viscosity may lead to the disturbance decaying exponentially. For the special case when the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers are equal, the solution can evolve into a periodic oscillation. A link between the unsteady critical-layer approach to high-Reynolds-number flow instability, and the wave vortex approach is identified"

Subcritical here means discontinuous and direct, with strong\nhysteresis. This is due to the existence of nontrivial flow regimes between the\nglobal stability threshold Re_g, the upper bound for unconditional return to\nthe base flow, and the linear instability threshold Re_c characterized by\nunconditional departure from the base flow. The transitional range around Re_g\nis first discussed from an empirical viewpoint ({\\S}1). The recent\ndetermination of Re_g for pipe flow by Avila et al. (2011) is recalled. Plane\nCouette flow is next examined. In laboratory conditions, its transitional range\ndisplays an oblique pattern made of alternately laminar and turbulent bands, up\nto a third threshold Re_t beyond which turbulence is uniform. Our current\ntheoretical understanding of the problem is next reviewed ({\\S}2): linear\ntheory and non-normal amplification of perturbations; nonlinear approaches and\ndynamical systems, basin boundaries and chaotic transients in minimal flow\nunits; spatiotemporal chaos in extended systems and the use of concepts from\nstatistical physics, spatiotemporal intermittency and directed percolation,\nlarge deviations and extreme values. Two appendices present some recent\npersonal results obtained in plane Couette flow about patterning from numerical\nsimulations and modeling attempts.Comment: 35 pages, 7 figures, to appear in Eur.

Firstly, using interpolation theory, the stochastic analysis techniques and a fixed-point theorem, the existence of p-mean piecewise weighted pseudo almost periodic in distribution mild solutions for the impulsive stochastic control system is presented. Secondly, the existence of optimal pairs of system governed by impulsive partial stochastic differential equations is also obtained. Finally, application to optimal control problems of impulsive parabolic control system is considered."

However, her method seems too general and in most cases too complicated for applications. We give, in this paper, a direct approach to the problem and obtain several such characterizations which do not seem to follow from those of Baesch. In particular, an explicit, necessary and sufficient condition to the problem is given for certain third order equations. The results again do not seem to follow from those of Baesch. Our method is based on that of 8 which in turn depends on basic representations of solutions given by Bank, Laine, and Langley."

This addresses some common\r\nproblems of existing face models. The PDE face benefits\r\nfrom seamless merging of surface patches by using only a\r\nrelatively small number of parameters based on boundary\r\ncurves. The PDE face also provides users with a great\r\ndegree of freedom to individualise the 3D face by\r\nadjusting a set of facial boundary curves. Furthermore, we\r\nintroduce a uv-mesh texture mapping method. By\r\nassociating the texels of the texture map with the vertices\r\nof the uv mesh in the PDE face, the new texture mapping\r\nmethod eliminates the 3D-to-2D association routine in\r\ntexture mapping. Any specific PDE face can be textured\r\nwithout the need for the facial expression in the texture\r\nmap to match exactly that of the 3D face model"

This instability, arising due to the combined action of flow and diffusion, creates spatially periodic stationary waves termed flow and diffusion-distributed structures (FDS). Here we show, via linear stability analysis, that FDS are predicted in a considerably wider domain and are more robust (in the parameter domain) than the classical Turing instability patterns. FDS also represent a natural extension of the recently discovered flow-distributed oscillations (FDO). Nonlinear bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations in one-dimensional spatial domains show that FDS also have much richer solution behaviour than Turing structures. In the framework presented here Turing structures can be viewed as a particular instance of FDS. We conclude that FDS should be more easily obtainable in chemical systems than Turing (and FDO) structures and that they may play a potentially important role in biological pattern formation"

For\nexample, the Ginzburg--Landau equation is a normal form that describes pattern\nformation due to the appearance of a single mode of instability in a wide\nvariety of dissipative problems. In a similar vein, a certain \"single-wave\nmodel\" arises in many physical contexts that share common pattern forming\nbehavior. These systems have Hamiltonian structure, and the single-wave model\nis a kind of Hamiltonian mean-field theory describing the patterns that form in\nphase space. The single-wave model was originally derived in the context of\nnonlinear plasma theory, where it describes the behavior near threshold and\nsubsequent nonlinear evolution of unstable plasma waves. However, the\nsingle-wave model also arises in fluid mechanics, specifically shear-flow and\nvortex dynamics, galactic dynamics, the XY and Potts models of condensed matter\nphysics, and other Hamiltonian theories characterized by mean field\ninteraction. We demonstrate, by a suitable asymptotic analysis, how the\nsingle-wave model emerges from a large class of nonlinear advection-transport\ntheories. An essential ingredient for the reduction is that the Hamiltonian\nsystem has a continuous spectrum in the linear stability problem, arising not\nfrom an infinite spatial domain but from singular resonances along curves in\nphase space whereat wavespeeds match material speeds (wave-particle resonances\nin the plasma problem, or critical levels in fluid problems). The dynamics of\nthe continuous spectrum is manifest as the phenomenon of Landau damping when\nthe system is ... Such dynamical phenomena have been rediscovered in different\ncontexts, which is unsurprising in view of the normal-form character of the\nsingle-wave model"

It is shown that, for a class of distributed delay\ndiferential quations, a symmetric period 2 solution, where the period is twice\nthe maximum delay, is given as a periodic solution of a Hamiltonian system of\nordinary differential equations. Proof of the idea is based on (Kaplan & Yorke,\n1974, J. Math. Anal. Appl.) for a discrete delay differential equation with an\nodd nonlinear function. To illustrate the results, we present distributed delay\ndifferential equations that have periodic solutions expressed in terms of the\nJacobi elliptic functions."

In the limit of small\ndeformations, a perturbative approach allows us to calculate filament shapes\nand the tension profile. We demonstrate that periodic filament motion can be\ngenerated via a self-organization of elastic filaments and molecular motors.\nOscillatory motion and the propagation of bending waves can occur for an\ninitially non-moving state via an instability termed Hopf bifurcation. Close to\nthis instability, the behavior of the system is shown to be independent of\nmicroscopic details of the axoneme and the force-generating mechanism. The\noscillation frequency however does depend on properties of the molecular\nmotors. We calculate the oscillation frequency at the bifurcation point and\nshow that a large frequency range is accessible by varying the axonemal length\nbetween 1 and 50$\\mu$m. We calculate the velocity of swimming of a flagellum\nand discuss the effects of boundary conditions and externally applied forces on\nthe axonemal oscillations.Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, REVTE"

        "abstract": "It is our pleasure to present this special issue. Differential, difference, and dynamic equations on time scales are often used for modeling various problems arising in the engineering and natural sciences. Therefore, analysis of qualitative properties of solutions to such equations is crucial for applications. It is important to develop new efficient methods, as well as to modify and refine well-known techniques adjusting them for the analysis of new classes of problems. In the call for papers prepared by the Guest Editors, we encouraged submission of state-of-the-art contributions on a wide spectrum of topics including asymptotic behavior of solutions, oscillation and nonoscillation, solvability of boundary value problems, existence of periodic and almost periodic solutions, stability properties of solutions, and applications to real world phenomena. This invitation was warmly welcomed by the mathematical community; more than sixty manuscripts addressing important problems in related areas were submitted to the Editorial Office and went through a thorough peer refereeing process. Thirty-eight research articles and two review articles reflecting modern trends and advances in functional differential, difference, and dynamic equations on time scales have been selected for this special issue. In the contribution by Y. Zhang et al., an adaptive scheme that can be used to analyze an open-circuit voltage of a battery is presented. H. Xi et al. study global behavior of a class of difference equations. In the paper by R. Guo, an improved average dwell time method is utilized to establish a number of stability results for a class of switched nonlinear systems. L. Gao et al. study a class of thirdorder nonlinear delay dynamic equations on time scales, whereas Q. Zhang et al. deal with a class of third-order nonlinear functional differential equations. Both papers establish sufficient conditions which ensure that every solution of a given equation is either oscillatory or converges to zero. For a class of two-dimensional nonlinear dynamic systems on time scales with a forced term, X. Zhang and S. Zhu obtain sufficient conditions for all solutions to be oscillatory. D. Cai et al. introduce a generalized Solow-Swan model for the analysis of the exogenous impact of population, saving rate, technological change, and labor participation rate on the economic growth. Y.-C. Qiu and Q.-R. Wang establish new oscillation results for a class of second-order nonlinear damped dynamic equations of a more general form. Y. Sun and T. S. Hassan present new oscillation criteria for a class of second-order nonlinear dynamic equations. Abstract and Applied Analysis In the paper by F. Wang, a comparison theorem for a fully nonlinear path-dependent parabolic partial differential equation is presented and some applications are considered. Z. Jiang et al. prove that the set of skew-circulants with complex entries has an idempotent basis. On this basis, a skewcyclic group of automorphisms and functional equations on the skew-circulant algebra is introduced. Using the inverse factorization of polynomial of degree , J. Li et al. express determinants of circulant and left circulant matrix involving Tribonacci numbers or generalized Lucas numbers in terms of Tribonacci numbers and generalized Lucas numbers. Q. He et al. investigate periodic nature of positive solutions of a class of fuzzy max-difference equations. Q. Li et al. discuss asymptotic properties of a class of third-order nonlinear neutral functional differential equations. In the paper by X. Jiang and K. Hong, the determinant problems for RSFPLR circulant matrices and RSLPFL circulant matrices involving Perrin, Padovan, Tribonacci, and generalized Lucas numbers are considered. In the paper by X. Fu et al., an energy management strategy for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle based on the driving cycle model and dynamic programming algorithm is proposed. Z. Jiang introduces a level-scaled factor circulant matrix over an arbitrary field and discusses its algebraic properties. S. Liu and Q. Zhang establish oscillation criteria of Gracetype for a class of second-order nonlinear dynamic equations with damping. Z. Jiang explores basic properties of FLSfactor block circulant (retrocirculant) matrices. Z. Jiang et al. consider circulant type matrices, including the circulant and left circulant and -circulant matrices with the sum and product of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. T. Xu et al. obtain explicit expressions for determinants of the RFP L R circulant matrices and RLP F L circulant matrices involving Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell, and Pell-Lucas numbers. In the paper by F. Yang and Q. Li, an improved cross entropy algorithm is proposed to solve the charge planning problem with orders in each charge. Using the nonlinear alternative of Leray-Schauder type and Banach fixed-point theorem, W.-X. Zhou and H. Liu establish existence and uniqueness of solution for a system of fractional differential equations. In the contribution by Q. H. Alqifiary and S.-M. Jung, the Gronwall inequality is used to prove the Hyers-Ulam stability of a class of secondorder differential equations. P. Hasil et al. demonstrate that existence of the mean values of coefficients is sufficient for second-order half-linear Euler-type differential equations to be conditionally oscillatory. An oscillation constant is determined explicitly even for equations with coefficients of variable sign. Using the method of coincidence degree, Y. Wang and M. Han construct a suitable Lyapunov functional to prove the existence of antiperiodic solutions of impulsive Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with delays on time scales and to investigate global exponential stability. The paper by S. R. Grace and M. A. El-Beltagy deals with the oscillatory behavior of forced secondorder integrodynamic equations on time scales. The results are new for the continuous and discrete cases and can be applied to Volterra integral equations on time scales. Two ellipsoidal ultimate boundary regions for a special threedimensional chaotic system are suggested by J. Wang et al. C. Wu et al. study two discrete predator-prey models in patchy environment, one without dispersal corridors and one with dispersal corridors. In the paper by H. Chen et al., a new method called a homoclinic (heteroclinic) breather limit method is proposed to find rogue wave solutions to nonlinear evolution equations. Using the generalized Riccati transformation and inequality technique, Q. Zhang and S. Liu establish oscillation criteria of Philos-type for second-order half-linear neutral delay dynamic equations with damping on time scales. Z.-L. Han et al. present several oscillation results for a class of even-order neutral delay differential equations with mixed nonlinearities. M. Dobkevich et al. present results on classification of solutions to boundary value problems for a class of second-order nonlinear differential equations. In this framework, existence and multiplicity results for different types of solutions are stated. Employing Lyapunov functions, Razumikhin method, and comparison principle, P. Wang et al. investigate relative integral stability of two differential systems with \"maxima\" in terms of two measures. In the contribution by A. Domoshnitsky et al., sufficient conditions for nonnegativity of a Cauchy matrix for a delay system are obtained without assuming nonpositivity of nondiagonal coefficients and a necessary condition for nonnegativity of a Cauchy matrix is suggested. Using results on nonnegativity of a Cauchy matrix, necessary and sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of a delay system are derived. H. Gu and T. An use a variant of the fountain theorem to study existence of multiple solutions for a class of superquadratic fourth-order elliptic problems with Navier boundary value conditions. X.-M. Zheng et al. investigate fixed points of solutions to a class of -difference equations. In the paper by Y. Zhang et al., the dynamics of a disease in a population of migratory birds modeled by a nonautonomous system with a Hassell-Varley type functional response and the saturation incidence rate is studied. Sufficient conditions are obtained for the permanence and extinction of the disease. Global attractivity of the model is discussed by constructing a Lyapunov function. C. Jiang et al. propose a new fractional-order chaotic complex system and study its dynamic properties including symmetry, equilibria and their stability, and chaotic attractors. The contribution by L. Caso et al. that reviews results on the unique solvability of the Dirichlet problem for second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations in nondivergence form with singular data in weighted Sobolev spaces closes this special issue. The editors hope that this collection of papers will attract interest of researchers working in related areas and will stimulate further progress in the qualitative theory of differential, difference, and dynamic equations on time scales."

In both cases we state two\nnovel, reliably upscaled equations for binary mixtures/multiphase fluids in\nstrongly heterogeneous systems by systematically taking thermodynamic features\nsuch as free energies into account as well as the system's heterogeneity\ndefined on the microscale such as geometry and materials (e.g. wetting\nproperties).

This system is derived from\nlinearizing the dispersive Camassa-Holm equation with unbounded perturbations\nat a small amplitude quasi-periodic function.

The main\ndifficulties in the reducibility we need to tackle come from the operator\n$J=(1-\\partial_{xx})^{-1}\\partial_{x}$, which induces the symplectic structure\nof the dispersive Camassa-Holm equation."

In this paper, a comparison of such\nthresholds between an artificial mouth, an experienced flutist and a non player\nis provided. It highlights the ability of the experienced player to\nconsiderabily shift regime change thresholds, and thus to enlarge its control\nin terms of nuances and spectrum. Based on recent works on other wind\ninstruments and on the theory of dynamic bifurcations, the hypothe- sis is\ntested experimentally and numerically that the dynamics of the blowing pressure\ninfluences regime change thresholds. The results highlight the strong influence\nof this parameter on thresholds, suggesting its wide use by experienced\nmusicians. Starting from these observations and from an analysis of a physical\nmodel of flute-like instruments, involving numerical continuation methods and\nFloquet stability analysis, a phenomenological modelling of regime change is\nproposed and validated. It allows to predict the regime change thresholds in\nthe dynamic case, in which time variations of the blowing pressure are taken\ninto account"

A relative periodic solution\nis a solution that is periodic in time, up to a transformation by an element of\nthe equation's symmetry group. With the method used, relative periodic\nsolutions are represented by a space-time Fourier series modified to include\nthe symmetry group element and are sought as solutions to a system of nonlinear\nalgebraic equations for the Fourier coefficients, group element, and time\nperiod. The 77 relative periodic solutions found for the CGLE exhibit a wide\nvariety of temporal dynamics, with the sum of their positive Lyapunov exponents\nvarying from 5.19 to 60.35 and their unstable dimensions from 3 to 8.\nPreliminary work indicates that weighted averages over the collection of\nrelative periodic solutions accurately approximate the value of several\nfunctionals on typical trajectories."

The model includes (second-order) viscous\ndispersion effects which originate from the streamwise momentum equation and\ntangential stress balance. These effects play a dispersive role that primarily\ninfluences the shape of the capillary ripples in front of the solitary pulses.\nWe show that different physical parameters, such as surface tension and\nviscosity, play a crucial role in the interaction between solitary pulses\ngiving rise eventually to the formation of bound states consisting of two or\nmore pulses separated by well-defined distances and travelling at the same\nvelocity. By developing a rigorous coherent-structure theory, we are able to\ntheoretically predict the pulse-separation distances for which bound states are\nformed. Viscous dispersion affects the distances at which bound states are\nobserved. We show that the theory is in very good agreement with computations\nof the second-order model.

        "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the homogenization (or upscaling) of a system of\npartial differential equations describing the non-ideal transport of a\nN-component electrolyte in a dilute Newtonian solvent through a rigid porous\nmedium. Realistic non-ideal effects are taken into account by an approach based\non the mean spherical approximation (MSA) model which takes into account finite\nsize ions and screening effects. We first consider equilibrium solutions in the\nabsence of external forces. In such a case, the velocity and diffusive fluxes\nvanish and the equilibrium electrostatic potential is the solution of a variant\nof Poisson-Boltzmann equation coupled with algebraic equations. Contrary to the\nideal case, this nonlinear equation has no monotone structure. However, based\non invariant region estimates for Poisson-Boltzmann equation and for small\ncharacteristic value of the solute packing fraction, we prove existence of at\nleast one solution. To our knowledge this existence result is new at this level\nof generality. When the motion is governed by a small static electric field and\na small hydrodynamic force, we generalize O'Brien's argument to deduce a\nlinearized model. Our second main result is the rigorous homogenization of\nthese linearized equations and the proof that the effective tensor satisfies\nOnsager properties, namely is symmetric positive definite. We eventually make\nnumerical comparisons with the ideal case. Our numerical results show that the\nMSA model confirms qualitatively the conclusions obtained using the ideal model\nbut there are quantitative differences arising that can be important at high\ncharge or high concentrations.Comment: 46 page"

Stochastic\nanalysis techniques relying on the theory of Markov semigroups for the study of\nthe RP spectrum and a rigorous reduction method is presented in Part I. This\nframework is here applied to study a stochastic Hopf bifurcation in view of\ncharacterizing the statistical properties of nonlinear oscillators perturbed by\nnoise, depending on their stability. In light of the H\\\"ormander theorem, it is\nfirst shown that the geometry of the unperturbed limit cycle, in particular its\nisochrons, is essential to understand the effect of noise and the phenomenon of\nphase diffusion. In addition, it is shown that the spectrum has a spectral gap,\neven at the bifurcation point, and that correlations decay exponentially fast.\nExplicit small-noise expansions of the RP eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are\nthen obtained, away from the bifurcation point, based on the knowledge of the\nlinearized deterministic dynamics and the characteristics of the noise. These\nformulas allow one to understand how the interaction of the noise with the\ndeterministic dynamics affect the decay of correlations. Numerical results\ncomplement the study of the RP spectrum at the bifurcation, revealing useful\nscaling laws. The analysis of the Markov semigroup for stochastic bifurcations\nis thus promising in providing a complementary approach to the more geometric\nrandom dynamical system approach. This approach is not limited to\nlow-dimensional systems and the reduction method presented in part I is applied\nto a stochastic model relevant to climate dynamics in part III"

Recent local numerical simulations (Prat &\nLigni\\`eres 2013, A&A, 551, L3) suggest that the coefficient for radial\nturbulent diffusion due to radial differential rotation satisfies $D_{\\rm\nt}\\simeq0.058\\kappa/Ri$, in qualitative agreement with Zahn's model. However,\nthis model does not apply when differential rotation is strong with respect to\nstable thermal stratification or when chemical stratification has a significant\ndynamical effect, a situation encountered at the outer boundary of\nnuclear-burning convective cores. We extend our numerical study to consider the\neffects of chemical stratification and of strong shear, and compare the results\nwith prescriptions used in stellar evolution codes. We performed local, direct\nnumerical simulations of stably stratified, homogeneous, sheared turbulence in\nthe Boussinesq approximation. The regime of high thermal diffusivities, typical\nof stellar radiative zones, is reached thanks to the so-called\nsmall-P\\'eclet-number approximation, which is an asymptotic development of the\nBoussinesq equations in this regime. The dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient on chemical stratification was explored in this approximation.\nMaeder's extension of Zahn's model in the strong-shear regime is not supported\nby our results, which are better described by a model found in the geophysical\nliterature.

For this purpose, the operational matrix of differentiation associated with the shifted Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind is derived. Utilizing the properties of this matrix, the solution of a system of differential equations can be found by solving a set of linear algebraic equations without constructing the equivalent integral equations. The Floquet Transition Matrix (FTM) can then be computed and its eigenvalues (Floquet multipliers) subsequently analyzed for stability. Two straightforward methods, the \u2018differential state space formulation\u2019 and the \u2018differential direct formulation\u2019, are presented and the results are compared with those obtained from other available techniques. The well-known Mathieu equation and a higher order system are used as illustrative examples."

Due to the same convection term of the Boltzmann equation\nand the Vlasov equation, it is very convenient to use the moment expansion in\nthe NRxx method to approximate the distribution function in the Vlasov\nequations. The moment closure recently presented in [5] is applied to achieve\nthe globally hyperbolicity so that the local well-posedness of the moment\nsystem is attained. This makes our simulations using high order moment\nexpansion accessible in the case of the distribution far away from the\nequilibrium which appears very often in the solution of the Vlasov equations.\nWith the moment expansion of the distribution function, the acceleration in the\nvelocity space results in an ordinary differential system of the macroscopic\nvelocity, thus is easy to be handled. The numerical method we developed can\nkeep both the mass and the momentum conserved. We carry out the simulations of\nboth the Vlasov-Poisson equations and the Vlasov-Poisson-BGK equations to study\nthe linear Landau damping. The numerical convergence is exhibited in terms of\nthe moment number and the spatial grid size, respectively. The variation of\ndiscretized energy as well as the dependence of the recurrence time on moment\norder is investigated. The linear Landau damping is well captured for different\nwave numbers and collision frequencies. We find that the Landau damping rate\nlinearly and monotonically converges in the spatial grid size. The results are\nin perfect agreement with the theoretic data in the collisionless case"

An analysis based on the energy method provides new results\nabout the asymptotic stability of the constant and periodic solutions. A\ncomplete analysis of the stability diagram is given.

Here, we consider a more general class of three-dimensional flame front perturbations which also permits corrugations in the streamwise direction. It is shown that, because of the stretch experienced by the flame, the hydrodynamic instability is limited only to disturbances of short wavelength. If in addition diffusion effects have a stabilizing influence, as would be the case of mixtures with Lewis number greater than one, a stretched flame could be absolutely stable. Instabilities occur when the Lewis number is below some critical value less than one. Neutral stability boundaries are presented in terms of the Lewis number, the strain rate, and the appropriate wavenumbers. Beyond the stability threshold, the two-dimensional self-similar modes always grow first. However, if disturbances of long wavelength are excluded, it is possible for the three-dimensional modes to be the least stable one. Accordingly, the pattern that will be observed on the flame front, at the onset of instability, will consist of either ridges in the direction of stretch or the more common three-dimensional cellular structure"

        "abstract": "Stability criteria have been derived and investigated in the last decades for\nmany kinds of periodic traveling wave solutions to Hamiltonian PDEs. They\nturned out to depend in a crucial way on the negative signature of the Hessian\nmatrix of action integrals associated with those waves. In a previous paper\n(Nonlinearity 2016), the authors addressed the characterization of stability of\nperiodic waves for a rather large class of Hamiltonian partial differential\nequations that includes quasilinear generalizations of the Korteweg--de Vries\nequation and dispersive perturbations of the Euler equations for compressible\nfluids, either in Lagrangian or in Eulerian coordinates. They derived a\nsufficient condition for orbital stability with respect to co-periodic\nperturbations, and a necessary condition for spectral stability, both in terms\nof the negative signature - or Morse index - of the Hessian matrix of the\naction integral. Here the asymptotic behavior of this matrix is investigated in\ntwo asymptotic regimes, namely for small amplitude waves and for waves\napproaching a solitary wave as their wavelength goes to infinity. The special\nstructure of the matrices involved in the expansions makes possible to actually\ncompute the negative signature of the action Hessian both in the harmonic limit\nand in the soliton limit. As a consequence, it is found that nondegenerate\nsmall amplitude waves are orbitally stable with respect to co-periodic\nperturbations in this framework. For waves of long wavelength, the negative\nsignature of the action Hessian is found to be exactly governed by the second\nderivative with respect to the wave speed of the Boussinesq momentum associated\nwith the limiting solitary wave"

        "abstract": "We present 3D MHD simulations of purely toroidal and mixed poloidal-toroidal\nmagnetic field configurations to study the behavior of the Tayler instability.\nFor the first time the simultaneous action of rotation and magnetic diffusion\nare taken into account and the effects of a poloidal field on the dynamic\nevolution of unstable toroidal magnetic fields is included. In the absence of\ndiffusion, fast rotation (rotation rate compared to Alfv\\'en frequency) is able\nto suppress the instability when the rotation and magnetic axes are aligned and\nwhen the radial field strength gradient p < 1.5. When diffusion is included,\nthis system turns unstable for diffusion dominated and marginally diffusive\ndominated regions. If the magnetic and rotation axes are perpendicular to each\nother the stabilizing effect induced by the Coriolis force is scale dependent\nand decreases with increasing wavenumber. In toroidal fields with radial field\ngradients bigger than p > 1.5, rapid rotation does not suppress the instability\nbut instead introduces a damping factor to the growth rate in agreement with\nthe analytic predictions. For the mixed poloidal-toroidal fields we find an\nunstable axisymmetric mode, not predicted analytically, right at the stability\nthreshold for the non-axisymmetric modes; it has been argued that an\naxisymmetric mode is necessary for the closure of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo\nloop.Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures.

        "abstract": "For many years it was believed that an unstable periodic orbit with an odd\nnumber of real Floquet multipliers greater than unity cannot be stabilized by\nthe time-delayed feedback control mechanism of Pyragus. A recent paper by\nFiedler et al uses the normal form of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation to give a\ncounterexample to this theorem. Using the Lorenz equations as an example, we\ndemonstrate that the stabilization mechanism identified by Fiedler et al for\nthe Hopf normal form can also apply to unstable periodic orbits created by\nsubcritical Hopf bifurcations in higher-dimensional dynamical systems. Our\nanalysis focuses on a particular codimension-two bifurcation that captures the\nstabilization mechanism in the Hopf normal form example, and we show that the\nsame codimension-two bifurcation is present in the Lorenz equations with\nappropriately chosen Pyragus-type time-delayed feedback. This example suggests\na possible strategy for choosing the feedback gain matrix in Pyragus control of\nunstable periodic orbits that arise from a subcritical Hopf bifurcation of a\nstable equilibrium. In particular, our choice of feedback gain matrix is\ninformed by the Fiedler et al example, and it works over a broad range of\nparameters, despite the fact that a center-manifold reduction of the\nhigher-dimensional problem does not lead to their model problem.Comment: 21 pages, 8 figures, to appear in PR"

        "abstract": "We study the response of a model micro-electrochemical cell to a large ac\nvoltage of frequency comparable to the inverse cell relaxation time. To bring\nout the basic physics, we consider the simplest possible model of a symmetric\nbinary electrolyte confined between parallel-plate blocking electrodes,\nignoring any transverse instability or fluid flow. We analyze the resulting\none-dimensional problem by matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of thin\ndouble layers and extend previous work into the strongly nonlinear regime,\nwhich is characterized by two novel features - significant salt depletion in\nthe electrolyte near the electrodes and, at very large voltage, the breakdown\nof the quasi-equilibrium structure of the double layers. The former leads to\nthe prediction of \"ac capacitive desalination\", since there is a time-averaged\ntransfer of salt from the bulk to the double layers, via oscillating diffusion\nlayers. The latter is associated with transient diffusion limitation, which\ndrives the formation and collapse of space-charge layers, even in the absence\nof any net Faradaic current through the cell. We also predict that steric\neffects of finite ion sizes (going beyond dilute solution theory) act to\nsuppress the strongly nonlinear regime in the limit of concentrated\nelectrolytes, ionic liquids and molten salts. Beyond the model problem, our\nreduced equations for thin double layers, based on uniformly valid matched\nasymptotic expansions, provide a useful mathematical framework to describe\nadditional nonlinear responses to large ac voltages, such as Faradaic\nreactions, electro-osmotic instabilities, and induced-charge electrokinetic\nphenomena.Comment: 30 pages, 17 eps-figures, RevTe"

The exact\nanalytical form of this distribution is unknown, but has often been represented\nempirically by q-exponential (Tsallis) functions. Based on the concepts of\nsuperstatistics, we introduce a framework for the statistical mechanics of an\nion trapped in an RF field subject to collisions with a buffer gas. We derive\nanalytic ion secular energy distributions from first principles both neglecting\nand including the effects of the thermal energy of the buffer gas. For a buffer\ngas with a finite temperature, we prove that Tsallis statistics emerges from\nthe combination of a constant heating term and multiplicative energy\nfluctuations. We show that the resulting distributions essentially depend on\nexperimentally controllable parameters paving the way for an accurate control\nof the statistical properties of ion-atom hybrid systems.Comment: Main text 6 pages, 4 figures.

        "abstract": "Vacuum-energy calculations with ideal reflecting boundaries are plagued by\nboundary divergences, which presumably correspond to real (but finite) physical\neffects occurring near the boundary. Our working hypothesis is that the stress\ntensor for idealized boundary conditions with some finite cutoff should be a\nreasonable ad hoc model for the true situation. The theory will have a sensible\nrenormalized limit when the cutoff is taken away; this requires making sense of\nthe Einstein equation with a distributional source. Calculations with the\nstandard ultraviolet cutoff reveal an inconsistency between energy and pressure\nsimilar to the one that arises in noncovariant regularizations of cosmological\nvacuum energy. The problem disappears, however, if the cutoff is a spatial\npoint separation in a \"neutral\" direction parallel to the boundary. Here we\ndemonstrate these claims in detail, first for a single flat reflecting wall\nintersected by a test boundary, then more rigorously for a region of finite\ncross section surrounded by four reflecting walls. We also show how the\nmoment-expansion theorem can be applied to the distributional limits of the\nsource and the solution of the Einstein equation, resulting in a mathematically\nconsistent differential equation where cutoff-dependent coefficients have been\nidentified as renormalizations of properties of the boundary. A number of\nissues surrounding the interpretation of these results are aired.Comment: 22 pages, 2 figures, 1 table; PACS 03.70.+k, 04.20.Cv, 11.10.G"

We examine here the consequences of breaking spatial reversibility on the snakes-and-ladders structure. We find that the localized states now drift, and show that the snakes-and-ladders\n\nstructure breaks up into a stack of isolas. We explore the evolution of this new structure with increasing reversibility breaking and study the dynamics of the system outside of the snaking region using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques"

Recently, the existence of periodic solutions for differential equations have arouse extensive attention. Most of the results obtained in literature are about the periodic solutions on delay differential equations. Only a small portion of the results [1, 2, 5, 8, 18, 19, 21] concern the periodic solutions on neutral differential equations. For the detailed basic theory, we would like to recommend interested readers to refer to [3, 6, 10\u201315, 17, 20, 22\u201324]. This note is inspired by [7] and [9] which discuss the existence of multiple periodic solutions for neutral differential equations with one and two order, and now we study the existence of periodic solutions for neutral differential equations (1.1) by applying two diverse methods. The following note will be described in these aspects. In Section 2, using Kranoselskii fixed point theorem to reveal that (1.1) exists periodic solutions. In Section 3, we state that Mawhin\u2019s continuation theorem is used for proving the existence of periodic solutions for (1.1)."

Since time delay occurs naturally in just about every interaction of the real world, here in this paper we see some differential equations with time delay, the so called functional differential equations or delay differential equations. In general, we used Banach Cacciopoli Theorem and Schauder's fixed point theorem to show the existence and uniqueness of solution of a neutral functional differential equation."

We adapt HB to solve for the stress response of the\nGiesekus model under large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) deformation. HB\ntransforms the system of differential equations to a set of nonlinear algebraic\nequations in the Fourier coefficients. Convergence studies find that the\ndifference between the HB and true solutions decays exponentially with the\nnumber of harmonics ($H$) included in the ansatz as $e^{-m H}$. The decay\ncoefficient $m$ decreases with increasing strain amplitude, and exhibits a \"U\"\nshaped dependence on applied frequency. The computational cost of HB increases\nslightly faster than linearly with $H$. The net result of rapid convergence and\nmodest increase in computational cost with increasing $H$ implies that HB\noutperforms the conventional method of using numerical integration to solve\ndifferential constitutive equations under oscillatory shear. Numerical\nexperiments find that HB is simultaneously about three orders of magnitude\ncheaper, and several orders of magnitude more accurate than numerical\nintegration. Thus, it offers a compelling value proposition for parameter\nestimation or model selection."

It is known to exhibit chaotic dynamics at the onset of pattern\nformation, at least when the dispersive terms in the equation are suppressed,\nas is commonly the practice in previous analyses. In this paper, the effects of\nreinstating the dispersive terms are examined. It is shown that such terms can\nstabilise some of the spatially periodic traveling waves; this allows us to\nstudy the loss of stability and transition to chaos of the waves.

In a situation where both modes are possible on the basis of linear theory a nonlinear theory must be used to determine the effect of the interaction of the instabilities. The details of this interaction are of practical importance because of its possible catastrophic effects on mechanisms used for laminar flow control. This interaction is studied in the context of fully developed flows in curved channels. A part form technical differences associated with boundary layer growth the structures of the instabilities in this flow are very similar to those in the practically more important external boundary layer situation. The interaction is shown to have two distinct phases depending on the size of the disturbances. At very low amplitudes two oblique Tollmein-Schlichting waves interact with a Goertler vortex in such a manner that the amplitudes become infinite at a finite time. This type of interaction is described by ordinary differential amplitude equations with quadratic nonlinearities"

Substitution of a perturbation of the form dictated by Floquet theory into these equations yields compatibility conditions which, when evaluated numerically, give the curves of neutral stability and constant disturbance growth rate. These results reveal that, for an internal wave of even infinitesimal amplitude, disturbance waves can begin to grow in amplitude. Moreover, these parametric instabilities are shown to reduce to the classical case of the nonlinear resonant interaction in the limit of vanishingly small basic-state amplitude. The fact that these unstable disturbances can exist for an internal wave of any amplitude suggests that this phenomenon may be an important mechanism for extracting energy from an internal gravity wave."

The disturbance streamfunction is expanded in a complete set of functions that satisfy the boundary conditions. The expansion is truncated after N terms, yielding a set of N linear first-order differential equations for the time dependence of the expansion coefficients. For the steady flow, calculations have been carried out for both symmetric and antisymmetric disturbances over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and disturbance wave-numbers. The neutral stability curve, curves of constant amplification and decay rate, and the eigenfunctions for a number of cases have been calculated. The eigenvalue spectrum has also been examined in some detail. The first N eigenvalues are obtained from the numerical calculations, and an asymptotic formula for the higher eigenvalues has been derived. For those values of the wave-number and Reynolds number for which calculations were carried out by L. H. Thomas, there is excellent agreement in both the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions with the results of Thomas. For the time-dependent flow, it was found, for small amplitudes of oscillation, that the modulation tended to stabilize the flow. If the flow was not completely stabilized then the growth rate of the disturbance was decreased. For a particular wave-number and Reynolds number there is an optimum amplitude and frequency of oscillation for which the degree of stabilization is a maximum. For a fixed amplitude and frequency of oscillation the wave-number of the disturbance and the Reynolds number has been varied and a neutral stability curve has been calculated. The neutral stability curve for the modulated flow shows a higher critical Reynolds number and a narrower band of unstable wave-numbers than that of the steady flow. The physical mechanism responsible for this stabiIization appears to be an interference between the shear wave generated by the modulation and the disturbance. For large amplitudes, the modulation destabilizes the flow. Growth rates of the modulated flow as much as an order of magnitude greater than that of the steady unmodulated flow have been found."

This extends results\nof Fiedler et al. [PRL 98, 114101 (2007)], who demonstrated that such feedback\ncontrol can stabilize the UPO associated with a two-dimensional subcritical\nHopf normal form. Pyragas feedback requires an appropriate choice of a feedback\ngain matrix for stabilization, as well as knowledge of the period of the\ntargeted UPO. We apply feedback in the directions tangent to the\ntwo-dimensional center manifold. We parameterize the feedback gain by a modulus\nand a phase angle, and give explicit formulae for choosing these two parameters\ngiven the period of the UPO in a neighborhood of the bifurcation point. We\nshow, first heuristically, and then rigorously by a center manifold reduction\nfor delay differential equations, that the stabilization mechanism involves a\nhighly degenerate Hopf bifurcation problem that is induced by the time-delayed\nfeedback. When the feedback gain modulus reaches a threshold for stabilization,\nboth of the genericity assumptions associated with a two-dimensional Hopf\nbifurcation are violated: the eigenvalues of the linearized problem do not\ncross the imaginary axis as the bifurcation parameter is varied, and the real\npart of the cubic coefficient of the normal form vanishes. Our analysis of this\ndegenerate bifurcation problem reveals two qualitatively distinct cases when\nunfolded in a two-parameter plane. In each case, Pyragas-type feedback\nsuccessfully stabilizes the branch of small-amplitude UPOs in a neighborhood of\nthe original bifurcation point, provided that the phase angle satisfies a\ncertain restriction.Comment: 35 pages, 19 figure"

To\nthis end, we write a computer code that solves the full time-dependent energy\nbalance, ionization balance, and radiation transfer equations in a\nself-consistent fashion for a simplified pure hydrogen case. It is shown that\nchanges in the ionizing radiation yield ionization/thermal fronts that\npropagate through the cloud, but the propagation times and response times to\nsuch fronts vary widely and non-linearly from the illuminated face of the cloud\nto the ionization front (IF). Ionization/thermal fronts are often supersonic,\nand in slabs initially in pressure equilibrium such fronts yield large pressure\nimbalances that are likely to produce important dynamical effects in the cloud.\n  Further, we studied the case of periodic variations in the ionizing flux. It\nis found that the physical conditions of the plasma have complex behaviors that\ndiffer from any steady-state solutions. Moreover, even the time average\nionization and temperature is different from any steady-state case. This time\naverage is characterized by over-ionization and a broader IF with respect to\nthe steady-state solution for a mean value of the radiation flux. Around the\ntime average of physical conditions there is large dispersion in instantaneous\nconditions, particularly across the IF, which increases with the period of\nradiation flux variations. Moreover, the variations in physical conditions are\nasynchronous along the slab due to the combination of non-linear propagation\ntimes for thermal/ionization fronts and equilibration times.Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ. 36 pages, 12 figure"

Then, we derive the so-called fluctuation-dissipation\nrelations which allow to describe the linear response of statistical\nobservables to small perturbations away from the time-periodic ergodic regime\nin a manner which only exploits the unperturbed dynamics. The results are\nformulated in an abstract setting but they apply to problems ranging from\naspects of climate modelling, to molecular dynamics, to the study of\napproximation capacity of neural~networks and robustness of their estimates."

Neutral helium atoms enhance the damping\nin certain temperature interval, where the ratio of neutral helium and neutral\nhydrogen atoms is increased. Therefore, the height-dependence of ionization\ndegrees of hydrogen and helium may influence the damping rate of Alfven waves.\nWe aim to study the effect of neutral helium in the damping of Alfven waves in\nstratified partially ionized plasma of the solar chromosphere. We consider a\nmagnetic flux tube, which is expanded up to 1000 km height and then becomes\nvertical due to merging with neighboring tubes, and study the dynamics of\nlinear torsional Alfven waves in the presence of neutral hydrogen and neutral\nhelium atoms. We start with three-fluid description of plasma and consequently\nderive single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations for torsional Alfven\nwaves. Thin flux tube approximation allows to obtain the dispersion relation of\nthe waves in the lower part of tubes, while the spatial dependence of\nsteady-state Alfven waves is governed by Bessel type equation in the upper part\nof tubes. Consecutive derivation of single-fluid MHD equations results in a new\nCowling diffusion coefficient in the presence of neutral helium which is\ndifferent from previously used one. We found that shorter-period (< 5 s)\ntorsional Alfven waves damp quickly in the chromospheric network due to\nion-neutral collision. On the other hand, longer-period (> 5 s) waves do not\nreach the transition region as they become evanescent at lower heights in the\nnetwork cores. Propagation of torsional Alfven waves through the chromosphere\ninto the solar corona should be considered with caution: low-frequency waves\nare evanescent due to the stratification, while high-frequency waves are damped\ndue to ion neutral collisions."

The required interfaces are far from\ntrivial, because rapid atomic processes in particular in the edge region of\nfusion plasmas require either smoothing and resampling, or frequent transfer of\nparticles from one into the other Monte Carlo code.

We show that the approximations and shortcomings of this \"single\nsourcing\" concept (e.g., restriction to explicit ion drift orbit integration)\ncan be fully tolerable in a wide range of typical fusion edge plasma\nconditions, and be overcompensated by the code-system simplicity, as well as by\ninherently ensured consistency in geometry (one single numerical grid only) and\n(the common) atomic and surface process modulesComment: 15 pages, 7 figure"

A finite set of independent slowly varying parameters are identified which parameterize the solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations in this subset of the phase space. Our parameterization of the weakly stable modes describes an attracting manifold of maximum-entropy configurations. The complementary modes, which have been neglected in this parameterization, are strongly damped. In order to seek a closure, a countably infinite number of modulation equations are\r\nderived on the long viscous time scale: a single equation for averaged kinetic energy and momentum; and the remaining equations for averaged powers of vorticity. Only a finite number of these vorticity modulation equations are required to determine the finite number of unknowns. The new results show that the evolution of the slowly varying amplitude parameters is determined by the vorticity field and that the phase velocity responds to these changes in the amplitude in accordance with the kinetic energy and momentum. The\r\nnew results also show that the most crucial physical mechanism in the production of vorticity is the interaction between vorticity and kinetic energy, this interaction being responsible for the existence of the attractor"

However, up to now, they have not been studied\nfor systems of conservation laws. Here, we (i) derive conditions for Turing\ninstability in conservation laws and (ii) use these conditions to find families\nof periodic solutions bifurcating from uniform states, numerically continuing\nthese families into the large-amplitude regime. For the examples studied,\nnumerical stability analysis suggests that stable periodic waves can emerge\neither from supercritical Turing bifurcations or, via secondary bifurcation as\namplitude is increased, from sub-critical Turing bifurcations. This answers in\nthe affirmative a question of Oh-Zumbrun whether stable periodic solutions of\nconservation laws can occur. Determination of a full small-amplitude stability\ndiagram-- specifically, determination of rigorous Eckhaus-type stability\nconditions-- remains an interesting open problem.Comment: 12 pages, 20 figure"

The exploration of periodic solutions and global behavior of nonlinear delay equations has started from this model. Another delay model for oscillations in populations is the blowfly equation which has been thought to be better suited to explain experiments. Also delay differential equations of neutral type have been proposed as population models. The Gurtin-MacCamy system of a partial differential equation with boundary condition models populations structured by age with birth and death rates depending on age and on total population size. If written as a renewal equation then piecewise constant coefficients, even with delta peaks, are admissible. It is shown that these \u201crealistic caricatures\u201d of age structure models are equivalent to delay equations, in general of neutral type. In the standard retarded case (as opposed to the neutral case) the resulting systems have the form of the blowfly equation. Hence the latter seems indeed better justified than the delayed logistic equation. In the case of neutral equations the age structure approach presented here is a rigorous derivation of such population models. Also in the retarded case the view on oscillations is drastically changed since Hutchinson\u2019s model and the blowfly model have distinct stability properties."

In\nthis paper, we introduce a family of sub-classes of ranked trees, called\nOmega-trees, which are characterized by imbalance of internal nodes. The degree\nof imbalance is defined by an integer 0 <= w. For caterpillars, the extreme\ncase of unbalanced trees, w = 0. Under models of neutral evolution, for\ninstance the Yule model, trees with small w are unlikely to occur by chance.\nIndeed, imbalance can be a signature of permanent selection pressure, such as\nobservable in the genealogies of certain pathogens. From a mathematical point\nof view it is interesting to observe that the space of Omega-trees maintains\nseveral statistical invariants although it is drastically reduced in size\ncompared to the space of unconstrained Yule trees. Using generating functions,\nwe study here some basic combinatorial properties of Omega-trees. We focus on\nthe distribution of the number of subtrees with two leaves. We show that\nexpectation and variance of this distribution match those for unconstrained\ntrees already for very small values of w"

In this paper, a new scheme of zero-sequence differential current protection based on waveform correlation is proposed. By analyzing the characteristics of zero-sequence current under internal fault, external fault and external fault removal, the waveform correlation of the zero-sequence current measured at the terminal of the transformer and the zero-sequence current measured at the neutral point of the transformer is used for identification. The polarity of the CT is selected to guarantee the zero-sequence currents at the terminal and neutral point of the transformer exhibit a \"ride through\" characteristic under external fault, then the waveform similarity is high, and the correlation coefficient is positive. On the other hand, when internal fault occurs, zero-sequence current waveforms on both sides differ from each other largely, and the correlation coefficient is negative. Through a large number of simulations verified by PSCAD/EMTDC, this criterion can accurately identify internal and external faults, exempt from effects of the recovery inrush. Moreover, it presents certain ability for CT anti-saturation."
