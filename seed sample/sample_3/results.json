The simplest examples of elicitable functionals are the mean that minimizes a quadratic score and the quantiles that are the set of minimizers of a piecewise linear score. Despite this notion finds its roots in decision theory, see for example Savage (1971), the term \u2018elicitable functional\u2019 seems to have been introduced in Osband (1985). See also Lambert et al. (2008), Gneiting (2011) and the reference therein for an early history of the notion of elicitability. We refer to the recent paper of Gneiting (2011) for the formal definition. Let T : M \u2192 2 be a possibly set-valued functional, where 2 is the power set of R. T is elicitable relative to the class M if there exists a scoring function S :",

        "abstract": "Elicitability is a property of R^k-valued functionals defined on a set of distribution functions. These functionals represent statistical properties of a distribution, for instance its mean, variance, or median. They are called elicitable if there exists a scoring function such that the expected score under a distribution takes its unique minimum at the functional value of this distribution. If such a scoring function exists, it is called strictly consistent for the functional. Motivated by the recent findings of Fissler and Ziegel concerning higher order elicitability, this thesis reviews the most important results, examples, and applications which are found in the relevant literature. Moreover, we also contribute our own examples and findings in order to give the reader a well-founded overview of the topic as well as of the most used tools and techniques. We include necessary and sufficient conditions for strictly consistent scoring functions, several elicitable as well as non-elicitable functionals and the use of elicitability in forecast comparison, regression, and estimation. Special emphasis is placed on quantitative risk management and the result that Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall are jointly elicitable.",

We find overall positive correlation between items and low explanatory power in terms of behavior. Using an average of seven risk elicitation methods reduces measurement noise and yields more predictive power. A reduced set of risk items yields the same external validity as the average of all seven methods. Hence, our multiple-item risk measures offer a more reliable way to measure risk preferences. Our results caution against the reliability of one risk method alone due to noise.",

In this paper, we analyze the elicitability properties of the\nclass of return risk measures (i.e., normalized, monotone and positively\nhomogeneous risk measures). First, we provide dual representation results for\nconvex and geometrically convex return risk measures. Next, we establish new\naxiomatic characterizations of Orlicz premia (i.e., Luxemburg norms). More\nspecifically, we prove, under different sets of conditions, that Orlicz premia\nnaturally arise as the only elicitable return risk measures. Finally, we\nprovide a general family of strictly consistent scoring functions for Orlicz\npremia, a myriad of specific examples and a mixture representation suitable for\nconstructing Murphy diagrams.",

To do that, we consider the notion of probability-based risk measurement and two general approaches to generate risk measures that are robust. The first approach is a worst-case situation, while the second one is based on weighted averaging. We develop results regarding issues on the theory of risk measures, such as financial and continuity properties, dual representations, law invariance and elicitability. Furthermore, we explore similar results for deviation measures under our framework.",

We find statistically significant violations of the expected utility hypothesis (EUH) consistent with disappointment aversion, and also find violations of first order stochastic dominance, but both sorts of violations are mostly small and only slightly impair the predictive power of a parametric implementation of EUH. The estimated coefficient of relative risk aversion, gamma, varies widely across individual subjects (consistent with EUH) and also across elicitation tasks (inconsistent with direct implementation of EUH). An alternative nonparametric measure of risk preferences displays similar patterns. The two risk preference measures are highly correlated with each other for each elicitation task. Each separate measure varies widely across individual subjects and across elicitation tasks, with low to nil correlation between BL tasks and HL tasks. Some of the variation across tasks can be explained by attributes such as graphical vs text representation that have no role in decision theory.",

Risk measures are positively correlated; however, their performance in explaining behavior is heterogeneous and, therefore, difficult to assess ex ante. To close this knowledge gap, greater diversification across risk measures is helpful. We do, indeed, find that performance increases considerably if single-item risk measures are combined to form multiple-item risk measures. They tend to improve results the more single-item measures they contain and if these single-item risk measures have different framings. Interestingly, survey items perform as well as incentivized experimental items in explaining risky behavior.",

We analyze how and when a simpler, but coarser, elicitation method may be preferred to the more complex, but finer, one. Results indicate that the more complex measure has overall superior predictive accuracy, but its downside is that subjects exhibit noisier behavior. Our main result is that subjects\u2019 numerical skills can help better assess this tradeoff: the simpler task may be preferred for subjects who exhibit low numeracy, as it generates less noisy behavior but similar predictive accuracy. For subjects with higher numerical skills, the greater predictive accuracy of the more complex task more than outweighs the larger noise. We also explore preference heterogeneity and provide methodological suggestions for future work.",

However, evidence suggests that attitudes towards risk may vary considerably when measured with different methods. Based on a within-subject experimental design using four widespread risk preference elicitation tasks, we find that the different methods indeed give rise to considerably varying estimates of individual and aggregate level risk preferences. Conducting simulation exercises to obtain benchmarks for subjects' behavior, we find that the observed heterogeneity in risk preference estimates across methods is qualitatively similar to the heterogeneity arising from independent random draws from the choice distributions observed in the experiment. Our study, however, provides evidence that subjects are surprisingly well aware of the variation in the riskiness of their choices. We argue that this calls into question the common interpretation of variation in revealed risk preferences as being inconsistent.",

        "abstract": "This chapter reviews extant research on the quality of expert judgement of probability and risk. Both types of judgement are of great relevance to the concerns of this book, because expert judgement under uncertainty is a key component in the making of decisions with scant information. In the first section, we focus on the conditions under which experts have produced high quality assessments of probability -in terms of both the coherence and validity of assessed probabilities. We conclude that invalid probability judgements are common when features of the judgement domain are unfavourable and \"learnability\" is low -by which we mean that there is a lack of relevant background data and/or outcome feedback upon which to base and revise domain models. We identify judgement situations when such conditions are likely to be prevalent. We also show that use of ill-matched probability elicitation methods are a common operational flaw. We propose a task taxonomy that can be used to identify when expert probability judgements are likely to be well-made. Next, we consider whether expert judgements of risk -by which we mean judgements of the likelihood of occurrence of hazardous events -are of higher quality than those made by members of the general public. We evaluate the nine empirical studies that have been conducted on expert versus lay judgements of risk, and find that there is little empirical evidence for the propositions (1) that experts judge risk differently from members of the public or (2) that experts are more veridical in their risk assessments. We discuss the nature of expertise and consider whether the commonsense assumption of the superiority of expert risk assessors in making magnitude judgements is, in fact, sensible. We end with a discussion of future research directions. 213 T. M. Williams et al. (eds.), Making Essential Choices with Scant Information",

The study of which properties are elicitable sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of point estimation and empirical risk minimization. While recent work asks which properties are elicitable, we instead advocate for a more nuanced question: how many dimensions are required to indirectly elicit a given property? This number is called the elicitation complexity of the property. We lay the foundation for a general theory of elicitation complexity, including several basic results about how elicitation complexity behaves, and the complexity of standard properties of interest. Building on this foundation, our main result gives tight complexity bounds for the broad class of Bayes risks. We apply these results to several properties of interest, including variance, entropy, norms, and several classes of financial risk measures. We conclude with discussion and open directions.",

Section Two provides an overview of the methodologies that have been developed to arrive at these probabilities and assesses their advantages and disadvantages. Section Three contains four suggestions to improve best practice in existential risk assessment. These suggestions centre on the types of probabilities used in risk assessment, the role of methodology rankings including the ranking of probabilistic information, the extended use of expert elicitation, and the use of confidence measures to better communicate uncertainty in probability assessments. Finally, Section Four provides an annotated literature review of catastrophic and existential risk probability claims as well as the methodologies that were used to produce each of them.",

This raises the question whether normative risk preferences can be elicited at all. Using two types of manipulation, I assess the normative value of risk preference elicitation methods. Following IRT, the results of the multiple lottery choice method are combined with two qualitative methods into a composite score. The responses of 9,235 pension fund members to a dedicated survey indicate this composite score approximates the latent variable normative risk preferences better than individual method responses do, substantially reducing measurement noise and method-specific biases. Analysis of the manipulations shows that both the results and the normative value of the risk preference elicitation methods depend on the specific amounts, order, and endowment chosen. Combining simpler methods with more advanced methods framed closely to the relevant situation increases the normative value of elicited risk preferences.",

We show by means of a simulation exercise that part of the often observed heterogeneity of estimates across tasks is due to task-specific measurement error induced by the mere mechanics of the tasks. We run a replication experiment in a homogeneous subject pool using a between subjects one-shot design. Results shows that the task estimates vary over and above what can be explained by the simulations. We investigate the possibility the tasks elicit different types of preferences, rather than simply provide a different measure of the same preferences. In particular, the availability of a riskless alternative plays a prominent role helping to explain part of the differences in the estimated preferences.",

A hypothesis derived from the psychology literature is that apparently inconsistent behavior can be explained by a subject\u2019s domain specific risk attitude as measured by existing instruments. Specifically, we consider whether different elicitation tasks are tapping into different aspects of a person\u2019s personality. The results show minimal evidence to support this explanation.

Bayes risk measures are the counterpart of elicitable risk measures, extensively studied in the recent literature. The Expected Shortfall (ES) is the most important coherent risk measure in both industry practice and academic research in finance, insurance, risk management, and engineering. One of our central results is that under a continuity condition, ES is the only class of coherent Bayes risk measures. We further show that entropic risk measures are the only risk measures which are both elicitable and Bayes. Several other theoretical properties and open questions on Bayes risk measures are discussed.",

We observe patterns of consistency in risk attitudes between two methods and within the selected multidimensional method, too. We find an evidence that gender and subjects\u2019 cognitive abilities play a certain role in the consistency of risk attitudes. Participants\u2019 choices in popular Holt and Laury method and the other two methods show nearly no relation. The principal component analysis supports the validity of the distinctive nature of the three risk elicitation methods. We also identify another aspect which is common in the different risk context; we call it the payoff risk sensitivity.",

Where QRA emphasizes formal quantitative assessment of the probable consequences caused by the recommended actions, and comparison to the probable consequences of alternatives, including the status quo, concern-driven risk management instead emphasizes perceived urgency or severity of the situation motivating recommended interventions. In many instances, especially those involving applications of the precautionary principle, no formal quantification or comparison of probable consequences for alternative decisions is seen as being necessary (or, perhaps, possible or desirable) prior to implementation of risk management measures. Such concern-driven risk management has been recommended by critics of QRA in several areas of applied risk management. Based on case studies and psychological literature on the empirical performance of judgment-based approaches to decision making under risk and uncertainty, we conclude that, although concern-driven risk management has several important potential political and psychological advantages over QRA, it is not clear that it performs better than (or as well as) QRA in identifying risk management interventions that successfully protect human health or achieve other desired consequences. Therefore, those who advocate replacing QRA with concern-driven alternatives, such as expert judgment and consensus decision processes, should assess whether their recommended alternatives truly outperform QRA, by the criterion of producing preferred consequences, before rejecting the QRA paradigm for practical applications.",

Abstract: In the context of eliciting preferences for decision making under risk, we ask the question: \"which might be the 'best' method for eliciting such preferences?\". It is well known that different methods differ in terms of the bias in the elicitation; it is rather less well-known that different methods differ in terms of their noisiness. The optimal trade-off depends upon the relative magnitudes of these two effects. We examine four different elicitation mechanisms (pairwise choice, willingness-to-pay, willingness-to-accept, and certainty equivalents) and estimate both effects. Our results suggest that economists might be better advised to use what appears to be a relatively inefficient elicitation technique (i.e. pairwise choice) in order to avoid the bias in better-known and more widely-used techniques.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Risk-taking has been a major field of interest for scientists and for applied purposes since decades. However, many researchers have noted that the current measurement instruments fail to show adequate validity and predictive power. Given the recent calls to develop new measures, this paper aims to highlight six key points that should be kept in mind when constructing or using measures of risk-taking concepts. Specifically, we encourage risk-taking scholars (a) to pay close attention to the terminology used in studies, (b) to distinguish measures of general and specific risk-taking, (c) to distinguish risk-taking from the appeal of risky activities, (d) to keep in mind the subjectivity of risk-taking, (e) to consider the measurement of passive risk-taking, and (f) to favour more realistic risk-taking tasks. Overall, these recommendations should help researchers to design and use more relevant risk-taking measures.",

We argue that a good external risk measure should be robust with respect to model misspecification and small changes in the data. A new class of data-based risk measures called natural risk statistics is proposed to incorporate robustness. Natural risk statistics are characterized by a new set of axioms. They include the Basel II and III risk measures and a subclass of robust risk measures as special cases; therefore, they provide a theoretical framework for understanding and, if necessary, extending the Basel Accords.",

Using item response theory (IRT), the results of four elicitation methods describing common latent variables identified as risk preferences are combined into a composite score. The responses of 9235 individuals to a dedicated survey indicate that the composite score is a more accurate estimation of latent risk preferences than the results of individual methods, substantially reducing measurement noise and method-specific biases. IRT improves accuracy by allowing variable weighting to be dependent on the most relevant range of each method in estimating latent risk preferences. Therefore, the composite score contains more information about latent risk preferences than the results of either factor-weighted or unweighted methods. Manipulating the specific amounts, order and starting point of the multiple price list method shows that the accuracy of this method is not impervious to framing effects. Combining simpler methods with more advanced methods, which are all framed closely to the relevant situation, yields a more accurate and more robust estimation of latent risk preferences.",

IDEA combines psychologically robust interactions among experts with mathematical aggregation of individual estimates. In particular, this research explores whether communication among experts adversely effects the reliability of group estimates.

        "abstract": "Decision\u2010makers in organisations and businesses make numerous decisions every day, and these decisions are expected to be based on facts and carried out in a rational manner. However, most decisions are not based on precise information or careful analysis due to several reasons. People are, e.g., unable to behave rationally as a result of their experiences, socialisation, and additionally, because humans possess fairly limited capacities for processing information in an objective manner. In order to circumvent this human incapacity to handle decision situations in a rational manner, especially those involving risk and uncertainty, a widespread suggestion, at least in managerial decision making, is to take advantage of support in the form of decision support systems. One possibility involves decision analytical tools, but they are, almost without exception, not efficiently employed in organisations and businesses. It appears that one reason for this is the high demands the tools place on the decision\u2010maker in a variety of ways, e.g., by presupposing that reliable input data is obtainable by an exogenous process. Even though the reliability of current decision analytic tools is highly dependent on the quality of the input data, they rarely contain methods for eliciting data from the users. The problem focused on in this thesis is the unavailability and inefficiency of methods for eliciting decision information from the users. The aim is to identify problem areas regarding the elicitation of decision data in real decision making processes, and to propose elicitation methods that take people\u2019s natural choice strategies and natural behaviour into account. In this effort, we have identified a conceptual gap between the decision\u2010makers, the decision models, and the decision analytical tools, consisting of seven gap components. The gap components are of three main categories (of which elicitation is one). In order to study elicitation problems, a number of empirical studies, involving more than 400 subjects in total, have been carried out in Sweden and Brazil. An iterative research approach has been adopted and a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods has been used. Findings made in this thesis include the fact that decision\u2010makers have serious problems in many decision situations due to not having access to accurate and relevant data in the first place, and secondly, not having the means for retrieving such data in a proper manner, i.e. lacking elicitation methods for this purpose. Employing traditional elicitation methods in this realm yield results that reveal an inertia gap, i.e. an intrinsic inertia in people\u2019s natural behaviour to shift between differently framed prospects, and different groups of decisionmakers displaying different choice patterns. Since existing elicitation methods are unable to deal with the inertia, we propose a class of methods to take advantage of this natural behaviour, and also suggest a representation for the elicited information. An important element in the proposed class of methods is also that we must be able to fine\u2010tune methods and measuring instruments in order to fit into different types of decision situations, user groups, and choice behaviours.",

        "abstract": "Decades of research identify risk perception as a largely intuitive and affective construct, in contrast to the more deliberative assessments of probability and consequences that form the foundation of risk assessment. However, a review of the literature reveals that many of the risk perception measures employed in survey research with human subjects are either generic in nature, not capturing any particular affective, probabilistic, or consequential dimension of risk; or focused solely on judgments of probability. The goal of this research was to assess a multidimensional measure of risk perception across multiple hazards to identify a measure that will be broadly useful for assessing perceived risk moving forward. Our results support the idea of risk perception being multidimensional, but largely a function of individual affective reactions to the hazard. We also find that our measure of risk perception holds across multiple types of hazards, ranging from those that are behavioral in nature (e.g., health and safety behaviors), to those that are technological (e.g., pollution), or natural (e.g., extreme weather). We suggest that a general, unidimensional measure of risk may accurately capture one's perception of the severity of the consequences, and the discrete emotions that are felt in response to those potential consequences. However, such a measure is not likely to capture the perceived probability of experiencing the outcomes, nor will it be as useful at understanding one's motivation to take mitigation action.",

In this paper we examine various factors that make it difficult to speak of the utility function for a given person. Similarly we show that it is questionable to pool risk-propensity data across studies (for descriptive purposes) that differ in the elicitation methods employed. The following five sources of bias or indeterminacy are hypothesized and demonstrated. First, certainty equivalence methods generally yield greater risk-seeking than probability equivalence methods. Second, the probability and outcome levels used in reference lotteries induce systematic bias. Third, combining gain and loss domains yields different utility measures than separate examinations of the two domains. Fourth, whether a risk is assumed or transferred away exerts a significant influence on people's preferences in ways counter to expected utility theory. Finally, context or framing differences strongly affect choice in a nonnormative manner. The above five factors are first discussed as essential choices to be made by the decision scientist in constructing Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions. Next, each is examined separately in view of existing literature, and demonstrated via experiments. The emerging picture is that basic preferences under uncertainty exhibit serious incompatibilities with traditional expected utility theory. An important implication of this paper is to commence development of a systematic theory of utility encoding which incorporates the many information processing effects that influence people's expressed risk preferences.",

        "abstract": "When the inputs to risk assessment models are unknown, a risk assessor might ask some people to guess at the unknown values. Although expert judgments and estimates may be incorrect, averages of expert guesses are sometimes much more accurate than individual guesses. This is especially true if the experts can provide (at least approximately) unbiased estimates with statistically independent errors. This is the basic insight behind the centuries-old Condorcet Jury Theorem, and behind some of the more recent enthusiasm for the \u201cwisdom of crowds.\u201d If expert judgments or estimates are averaged, should those from different experts be weighted differently, e.g., to reflect the different degrees of calibration and informativeness estimated for different experts? The \u201cClassical Method\u201d made famous by Roger Cooke and others argues yes. In the first article in this issue, Bolger and Rowe argue no, or at least that there is little evidence that externally imposed weighting schemes lead to more reliable or valid final estimates than simple unweighted averaging. Robert Winkler, one of the world\u2019s top experts on expert aggregation (Bayesian and otherwise), contributes a supporting commentary noting that, empirically, simply averaging expert judgments without weighting them often out-performs more sophisticated approaches, including weighted averages, in part because it avoids the need to choose (possibly erroneously) which experts should receive how much more or less weight than others. Granger Morgan challenges the notion that \u201cfor policy making a single representation of the uncertain quantity, and related probability, is commonly needed,\u201d arguing that the world is often not so simple, and that policy-making needs to learn to deal with realistic and essential complexities. For example, some experts may believe that a proposed action will have large impacts, and others may be convinced that it will not; in such cases, as Bolger and Rowe also note, averaging their estimates will not inform policy-makers about the genuine diversity of expert opinions. Roger Cooke, the father of the Classical Method, notes that it has a substantial track record of useful applications, and that weighting demonstrably works well in some circumstances. Bolger and Rowe reply to these commentaries, noting points of agreement and disagreement and emphasizing the desirability of rigorous experimental evaluation of the performance of different methods, avoiding training and testing in the same data set, and noting that their key recommendation is not for equal weighting instead of performance weighting, but for \u201cbehavioral aggregation\u201d (from within the expert elicitation and reconciliation process itself) rather than externally developed weighting schemes, as in the Classical Method. The article, commentaries, and responses highlight the importance of better understanding, validating, and characterizing the performance of expert guesses in risk assessment, bearing in mind the possibilities that some quantities may simply not be accurately predictable from available information, and that different experts may sometimes have very different opinions. A later paper in this issue, by Jensen and Ritz, looks at how to weight and combine the estimates from different models, e.g., different nonlinear doseresponse models, all of which may provide plausibleseeming fits to the available data, in the context of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) for quantifying effects of model uncertainty. They show the practical impact of BMA on widening confidence intervals and obtaining more realistic estimates, including simultaneous inference about derived model parameters, while allowing for model uncertainty. The performance of different BMA techniques, using weights based on statistical measures such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), is illustrated using both simulation studies and diverse practical examples. The examples include estimation of associations between duration of breastfeeding and adult IQ, estimation of benchmark dose (BMD) for the ecotoxicity of copper, as indicated by reductions in the lengths of giant kelp germination tubes, and estimation of infectious doses of microbial contaminants in foods.

We obtain two main analytical results in dimension one and dimension two, by characterizing the CxLS property of all one\u2010dimensional signed Choquet integrals, and that of all two\u2010dimensional signed Choquet integrals with a quantile component. Using these results, we proceed to show that under some continuity assumption, a comonotonic\u2010additive coherent risk measure is co\u2010elicitable with Value\u2010at\u2010Risk if and only if it is the corresponding Expected Shortfall.

Risk is ubiquitous in decision-making. The extent to which people are willing to take on risk constitutes their risk prefernces. Assessing and measuring the risk preferences of individuals is critical for economic analysis and policy prescriptions. allmark theories of risk and uncertainty such as subjective expected utility (Savage, 1954) and prospect theory (Kahneman nd Tversky, 1979) leave risk attitudes as a free parameter, and individuals may have differing attitudes toward risk. For example, when given a chance to purchase a lottery ticket with equal chances of winning either $10 or $0, a riskeutral individual will be willing to pay up to $5\u2014the expected value of the lottery. Individuals who are only willing to pay ess than $5 are considered to be risk-averse, while those willing to pay more are considered to be risk-seeking. Any of these isk attitudes is consistent with all theories, given some risk-attitude parameters.

Simple elicitation methods tend to be substantially easier for participants to understand. For example, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (Lejuez et al., 2002) presents subjects with a sequence of choices of whether or not to gain additional money by pumping more air into a balloon, each pump coming with the risk of losing the accumulated gains if the balloon pops. Other simple elicitation methods include a single choice of how much to allocate between a safe and risky asset (Gneezy and Potters, 1997; Charness and Gneezy, 2012), a single choice between gambles (Eckel and Grossman, 2002; Dave et al., 2010), and non-incentivized questionnaires (Weber et al., 2002; Dohmen et al., 2011). Simple methods are most useful when trying to capture treatment effects and differences in individual risk preferences. We wish to emphasize that we are not suggesting that one method is better than another. Rather, we simply highlight the costs and benefits of different methods, urging researchers to take these into account when choosing the one that best fits their needs. Elicitation approaches should be tailored to the underlying question being asked, with attention paid to the abilities of the participants to understand the questions. We now proceed to examine specific elicitation techniques that have been used in the literature, discussing the relative advantages and disadvantages of each. 1. Elicitation methods 1.1. The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) measures risk preferences by presenting individuals with a computer simulation of pumping air into a series of balloons (Lejuez et al., 2002). Balloons of three different colors (blue, yellow and orange) are presented one at a time. For each successive pump, the balloon grows in size and the individual earns money that is deposited into a temporary reserve. The value of the reserve is never revealed to the participant. As the balloon becomes bigger, the chances that it would pop after another pump grows as well; the probability of popping is negligible before the first pump and grows to certainty after the balloon reaches a particular size. If the balloon pops, all earnings in the temporary reserve disappear and a new balloon appears. At any given time, the participant can either pump the balloon or collect what she has earned so far. If the participant chooses to collect her earnings, that money is deposited into her permanent account and a new balloon appears. She then faces the same scenario with the next balloon. The BART is a good example of a class of methods that aims to elicit risk preferences in a context that is familiar and easy to grasp (see also Crosetto and Filippin, 2012). It has also been used to study risk attitudes across a variety of subfields such as neuroscience (Fecteau et al., 2007), drug addiction (Bornovalova et al., 2005) and psychopathology (Hunt et al., 2005). The probability of popping increases monotonically with each successive pump and evolves according to a function specific to the color of the balloon. The blue balloon, for example, has a 1/128 probability of popping after the first pump, 1/127 after the second, 1/126 after the third, and so on. After 128 pumps, the balloon is guaranteed to pop. It takes 8 and 32 pumps respectively to pop the orange and yellow balloons with certainty. Participants are told that the balloons would explode after enough pumps, but the actual probability function is never revealed. This procedure was designed to model situations where excessive risk-taking leads to diminishing returns and greater hazards. Particularly, with each successive pump, the amount that could potentially be lost increases and the overall expected gain decreases. Individuals are presented with 90 balloons in total, with the colors randomized accordingly. Since each successive pump carried an increased risk of causing the balloon to pop, the authors took the average number of pumps, excluding balloons that exploded, to be the adjusted value corresponding to the individual\u2019s risk preference. This value correlated significantly with reported real-world risky behavior such as gambling, drug use and unprotected sex, as well as self-reported risk constructs that measured impulsiveness and sensation seeking. Lejuez et al. (2003) found that risk preferences elicited using the BART correlated significantly with self-reported risk-taking in daily life in a population of high school students, as measured by the CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. However, it is not clear if risk preferences elicited through these methods extend to other domains, in particular financial decision-making (which is of particular interest to economists), or if they are associated with risk preferences elicited through other methods (Buelow and Suhr, 2009). In addition, the BART requires a computer and multiple trials to implement. Hence, it may not be ideal for being paired with other decision-making tasks, when time is a factor, or for field work where access to computers is limited.",

Abstract: Elicitation methods in decision making under risk allow a researcher to infer the subjective utilities of outcomes as well as the subjective weights of probabilities from the observed preferences of an individual. An optimally efficient elicitation method is proposed, which takes into account the inevitable distortion of preferences by random errors and minimizes the effect of such errors on the inferred utility and probability weighting functions. Under mild assumptions, the optimally efficient method for eliciting utilities (weights) of many outcomes (probabilities) is the following three-stage procedure. First, a probability is elicited whose subjective weight is one half. Second, an individual's utility function is elicited through the midpoint chaining certainty equivalent method employing the probability elicited at the first stage as an input. Finally, an individual's probability weighting function is elicited through the probability equivalent method.",

Decision and risk analysis were designed to improve judgments and decisions and to overcome many of these biases. However, when eliciting model components and parameters from decisionmakers or experts, analysts often face the very biases they are trying to help overcome. When these inputs are biased they can seriously reduce the quality of the model and resulting analysis. Some of these biases are due to faulty cognitive processes; some are due to motivations for preferred analysis outcomes. This article identifies the cognitive and motivational biases that are relevant for decision and risk analysis because they can distort analysis inputs and are difficult to correct. We also review and provide guidance about the existing debiasing techniques to overcome these biases. In addition, we describe some biases that are less relevant because they can be corrected by using logic or decomposing the elicitation task. We conclude the article with an agenda for future research.",

Yet beyond a widening frontier of special cases, the two most fundamental questions in this area remain open: which statistics are elicitable (computable via ERM), and which loss functions elicit them? Moreover, recent work suggests a complementary line of questioning: given a statistic, how many ERM parameters are needed to compute it? We give concrete instantiations of these important questions, which have numerous applications to machine learning and related fields.",

Results indicate that the more complex measure has an overall superior predictive accuracy, but its downside is that subjects exhibit noisier behavior; conversely, the simpler measure has the opposite costs and benefits. Our main result is that subjects' numerical skills can help better assess this tradeoff: the simpler task may be preferred when subjects exhibit low numeracy as it generates less noisy behavior but similar predictive accuracy than the more complex task; conversely, for subjects with higher numerical skills, the greater predictive accuracy of the more complex task more than outweighs the larger noise.

At the same time, subjects on average think that others are more risk averse than themselves. The data also reveals that subjects are quite inconsistent when making risk decisions on behalf of others. A large majority of subjects alternates between taking more risk, less risk or the same amount of risk with other people's money compared to own money.",

Abstract The literature on social preferences provides overwhelming evidence of departures from pure self-interest of individuals. Experiments show that people care about others' well-being and their relative standing. This paper investigates whether this type of behavior persists when risk comes into play. I devise an experiment which sheds light on the interrelation of risk and social preferences by measuring (1) individual risk preferences, (2) interpersonal risk preferences, and (3) social preferences under certainty. The results reveal that a large share of subjects choose to accept more risk or less potential gain than individually preferred in order to increase another subject's payoff. Further, the willingness to do so appears to be influenced by the \"need\" of the other person and her potential relative standing. Surprisingly, the results do not suggest that a subject's social behavior under risk is related to his social concerns exhibited under certainty. JEL Classification: C91, D63, D81",

Survey data were collected in 1996; total number of respondents was approximately 1,000 (United Kingdom and Spain), 1,350 (France), and 2,050 (Sweden). Trust was a significant predictor of perceived risk within countries, but the strength of the relationship varied from weak (Spain and France) to moderate (United Kingdom and Sweden). General trust was also a significant source of variation in perceived risk among countries, but much of the variation in perceived risk remained unexplained. Correlations between trust and risk perception also varied depending on the type of risk (i.e., nuclear risks were more influenced by trust) and trust measure (i.e., general trust explained perceived risk better than specific trust). It is concluded that trust may be an element in models explaining risk perception, but it is not as powerful as often argued in the risk perception literature.",

We propose a new, data based, risk measure, called natural risk statistic, that is characterized by a new set of axioms. The new axioms only require subadditivity for comonotonic random variables, which is consistent with the prospect theory in psychology. Comparing to two previous measures, the natural risk statistic includes the tail conditional median which is more robust than the tail conditional expectation suggested by the coherent risk measure; and, unlike insurance risk measures, the natural risk statistics can also incorporate scenario analysis. The natural risk statistic includes the VaR as a special case and therefore shows that VaR, though simple, is not irrational.",

There is a large theoretical literature on the elicitation of subjective probabilities, and an equally large empirical literature. However, there is a gulf between the two. The theoretical literature proposes a range of procedures that can be used to recover subjective probabilities, but stresses the need to make strong auxiliary assumptions or \"calibrating adjustments\" to elicited reports in order to recover the latent probability. With some notable exceptions, the empirical literature seems intent on either making those strong assumptions or ignoring the need for calibration. We illustrate how the joint estimation of risk attitudes and subjective probabilities using structural maximum likelihood methods can provide the calibration adjustments that theory calls for. This allows the observer to make inferences about the latent subjective probability, calibrating for virtually any well-specified model of choice under uncertainty. We demonstrate our procedures with experiments in which we elicit subjective probabilities. We calibrate the estimates of subjective beliefs assuming that choices are made consistently with expected utility theory or rank-dependent utility theory. Inferred subjective probabilities are significantly different when calibrated according to either theory, thus showing the importance of undertaking such exercises. Our findings also have implications for the interpretation of probabilities inferred from prediction markets.",

The other measure is a psychometric approach based on Likert statements that produces a unidimensional risk attitude scale. The data are from computer-assisted interviews of 346 Dutch owner-managers of hog farms, who made decisions about their own businesses. While the measures demonstrate some degree of convergent validity, those measures based on lotteries were better predictors of actual market behavior. In contrast the psychometric scale showed more agreement to selfreported measures of innovativeness, market orientation, and the intention to reduce risk. In light of the higher predictive validity of lottery-based measurements, werecommend elicitation methods based on the expected utility paradigm.",

Instead of opposing an objective bounding analysis, where only statistically founded probability distributions are taken into account, to the full\u2010fledged probabilistic approach, exploiting expert subjective judgment, we advocate the idea that both analyses are useful and should be articulated with one another. Moreover, the idea that risk analysis under incomplete information is purely objective is misconceived. The use of uncertainty theories cannot be reduced to a choice between probability distributions and intervals. Indeed, they offer representation tools that are more expressive than each of the latter approaches and can capture expert judgments while being faithful to their limited precision. Consequences of this thesis are examined for uncertainty elicitation, propagation, and at the decision\u2010making step.",

We develop and discuss results regarding the preservation of properties and acceptance sets for the combinations of risk measures. One of the main results is the representation for resulting risk measures from the properties of both alternative functionals and combination functions. To that, we build on the development of a representation for arbitrary mixture of convex risk measures. In this case, we obtain a penalty that recalls the notion of inf-convolution under theoretical measure integration. As an application, we address the context of probability-based risk measurements for functionals on the set of distribution functions. We develop results related to this specific context. We also explore features of individual interest generated by our framework, such as the preservation of continuity properties, the representation of worst-case risk measures, stochastic dominance and elicitability. We also address model uncertainty measurement under our framework and propose a new class of measures for this task.",

While several recent papers have approached the general question of which properties are elicitable, we suggest that this is the wrong question---all properties are elicitable by first eliciting the entire distribution or data set, and thus the important question is how elicitable. Specifically, what is the minimum number of regression parameters needed to compute the property? Building on previous work, we introduce a new notion of elicitation complexity and lay the foundations for a calculus of elicitation. We establish several general results and techniques for proving upper and lower bounds on elicitation complexity. These results provide tight bounds for eliciting the Bayes risk of any loss, a large class of properties which includes spectral risk measures and several new properties of interest. Finally, we extend our calculus to conditionally elicitable properties, which are elicitable conditioned on knowing the value of another property, giving a necessary condition for the elicitability of both properties together.",

        "abstract": "In risky situations characterized by imminent decisions, scarce resources and insufficient data, policy makers rely on experts to estimate model parameters and their associated uncertainties. Different elicitation and aggregation methods can vary substantially in their efficacy and robustness. While it is generally agreed that biases in expert judgements can be mitigated using structured elicitations involving groups rather than individuals, there is still some disagreement about how to best elicit and aggregate judgements. This mostly concerns the merits of using performance-based weighting schemes to combine judgements of different individuals (rather than assigning equal weights to individual experts), and the way that interaction between experts should be handled. This paper aims to contribute to, and complement the ongoing discussion on these topics.",

Since decision noise leads to bias in most elicitation tasks, there is a risk of falsely interpreting noise-driven relationships as preference driven. This puts previous studies that found a negative relation between personality measures and risk aversion into perspective and in particular raises the question of how to achieve robust inference in this domain. This paper shows, by way of an economic experiment with subjects from all walks of life, that using structural estimation to model heterogeneity of noise in combination with a balanced design allows us to mitigate the bias problem. Our estimations show that cognitive ability is related to noisy behavior rather than risk preferences. We also find age and education to be strongly related to noise, but the personality characteristics obtained using the Big Five inventory are less related to noise and more robustly correlated to risk preferences.",

This paper attempts to characterize perceived ecological risk, using the psychometric paradigm developed in the domain of human health risk perception. The research began by eliciting a set of scale characteristics and risk items (e.g., technologies, actions, events, beliefs) from focus group participants. Participants in the main study were 68 university students who completed a survey instrument that elicited ratings for each of 65 items on 30 characteristic scales and one scale regarding general risk to natural environments. The results are presented in terms of mean responses over individuals for each scale and item combination. Factor analyses show that five factors characterize the judgment data. These have been termed: impact on species, human benefits, impact on humans, avoidability, and knowledge of impacts. The factor results correspond with initial expectations and provide a plausible characterization of judgments regarding ecological risk. Some comparisons of mean responses for selected individual items are also presented.",

It is well known that risk aversion can dramatically affect the incentives to correctly report the true subjective probability of a binary event. Alternatively, one must carefully calibrate inferences about true subjective probabilities from elicited subjective probabilities over binary events, recognizing the incentives that risk averse agents have to report the same probability for the two outcomes and reduce the variability of payoffs from the scoring rule. We characterize the comparable implications of the general case of a risk averse agent when facing a popular scoring rule over continuous events, and find that these concerns do not apply with anything like the same force. For empirically plausible levels of risk aversion, one can reliably elicit most important features of the latent subjective belief distribution without undertaking calibration for risk attitudes.",

Abstract Ambiguity aversion has shown to be economically relevant and has been proposed as an explanation for many phenomena in economics and finance. While the literature has suggested a large variety of elicitation methods to measure ambiguity preferences, their consistency and reliability it is rarely evaluated. This is the first study that systematically analyses the consistency of individual ambiguity preferences elicited using a variety of incentivized tasks, non-incentivized thought experiments and survey questions. We find a high degree of aggregate consistency across elicitation methods, but large discrepancies in degrees of individual consistency in pair-wise tasks comparisons. Finally, the study identifies a set of non-incentivized tasks that predict ambiguity attitudes elicited experimentally which may serve as a viable alternative when running laboratory experiments is unfeasible.

To our knowledge, such loss functions have not been studied before in the area of property elicitation or in machine learning more broadly. As compared to traditional loss functions that take only a single data point, these multi-observation loss functions can in some cases drastically reduce the dimensionality of the hypothesis required. In elicitation, this corresponds to requiring many fewer reports; in empirical risk minimization, it corresponds to algorithms on a hypothesis space of much smaller dimension. We explore some examples of the tradeoff between dimensionality and number of observations, give some geometric characterizations and intuition for relating loss functions and the properties that they elicit, and discuss some implications for both elicitation and machine-learning contexts.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the financial industry and regulators have enhanced the debate on the good properties of a risk measure. A fundamental issue is the evaluation of the quality of a risk estimation. On the one hand, a backtesting procedure is desirable for assessing the accuracy of such an estimation and this can be naturally achieved by elicitable risk measures. For the same objective, an alternative approach has been introduced by Davis [Stat. Risk Model. Appl. Finance Insurance, 2016, 33, 67\u201393] through the so-called consistency property. On the other hand, a risk estimation should be less sensitive with respect to small changes in the available data-set and exhibit qualitative robustness. A new risk measure, the Lambda value at risk (), has been recently proposed by Frittelli et al. [Math. Finance, 2014, 24, 442\u2013463], as a generalization of VaR with the ability to discriminate the risk among P&L distributions with different tail behaviour. In this article, we show that also satisfies the properties of robustness, elicitability and consistency under some conditions.",

One methodology designed for comparing diverse risks of this sort is the Deliberative Method of Ranking Risks. Previous studies have evaluated the utility of the method in absolute terms, examining informed rankings at various stages of the process; this paper represents the first known approach to compare the method relative to another approach. As the Deliberative Method for Ranking Risks is designed to engage deliberative System 2 thought, we compared the rankings from the method to those from a nationally representative survey (RAND\u2019s American Life Panel) that engages experiential System 1 thought. We find evidence that the Deliberative Method for Ranking Risks works as intended, developing more informed rankings with less evidence of bias. The Deliberative Method for Ranking Risks can be a useful improvement for ad hoc comparisons of risk in the homeland security domain.",

However, the term misinformation in relation to risk has not yet been clearly interpreted by the risk field. Basic definitions of misinformation point to false, incorrect, inaccurate and misleading information. However, when it comes to risk, there is in many cases no reference for what is the truth - the risk magnitude needs to be evaluated on the basis of analysis and judgments. What is judged as misinformation by some, could be seen as adequate information by others. In this paper we reflect on the meaning and scope of the misinformation concept in relation to risk and uncertainty. The main goal is to obtain new knowledge on the topic by relating the discussion to risk science fundamentals, on the understanding, characterization and perception of risk. A structure for a classification of misinformation in relation to risk is proposed. Several measures are also presented to explore how to meet the misinformation challenge in risk contexts.",

Beginning in the mid-1960s, in a series of experiments seminal to the field later called behavioral economics, Sarah Lichtenstein, Paul Slovic, Amos Tversky, and others showed that decision patterns violating EUT are systematic. The new experimenters who engaged with the EUT-based measurement of utility from the mid-1970s, namely Uday Karmarkar, Richard de Neufville, Paul Schoemaker, and coauthors, showed that different elicitation methods to measure utility, which according to EUT should produce the same outcome, generate different measures. These findings contributed to destabilizing EUT, undermined the confidence in EUT-based utility measurement, and helped foster a blossoming of novel behavioral models of decision-making under risk.",

        "abstract": "A statistical functional, such as the mean or the median, is called elicitable if there is a scoring function or loss function such that the correct forecast of the functional is the unique minimizer of the expected score. Such scoring functions are called strictly consistent for the functional. The elicitability of a functional opens the possibility to compare competing forecasts and to rank them in terms of their realized scores. In this paper, we explore the notion of elicitability for multi-dimensional functionals and give both necessary and sufficient conditions for strictly consistent scoring functions. We cover the case of functionals with elicitable components, but we also show that one-dimensional functionals that are not elicitable can be a component of a higher order elicitable functional. In the case of the variance this is a known result. However, an important result of this paper is that spectral risk measures with a spectral measure with finite support are jointly elicitable if one adds the `correct' quantiles. A direct consequence of applied interest is that the pair (Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall) is jointly elicitable under mild conditions that are usually fulfilled in risk management applications.",

Even though long-standing observations suggest that how risky outcomes are presented changes people's behavior, it is unclear whether risk sensitivity is a unitary trait that can be measured by any one of these instruments. To directly answer this question, we administered three tasks commonly used to elicit risk sensitivity within-subject to a large sample of participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our findings revealed high individual variability in each measure, with little evidence of consistency among different tasks: many participants who were classified as \"risk-averse'' in one task were \"risk-seeking'' in another, and we observed no significant correlations between continuous measures of risk sensitivity as measured in each of the tasks. Our results cast doubt on the pervasive assumption that risk paradigms measure a single underlying trait, and suggest instead that behavior in risky situations is the result of heterogeneous, interacting, and possibly task-dependent cognitive mechanisms.",

Several recent efforts have laid the groundwork for a conceptual model outlining four key factors that make up risk perception: exposure, susceptibility, severity, and affective response. In this article, we use an extensive scale\u2010development process to develop empirically supported 3\u20134 item subscales to measure each of those four dimensions. Using cognitive interviewing techniques and several quantitative psychometric methods including exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and item\u2010response theory analyses, we reduce a large set of potential items to the highest\u2010quality items to assess each subscale. These subscales can be used to make comparisons across perceived risk in different hazard contexts and populations.",

As this risk measure has to be estimated from historical data, it is important to be able to verify and compare competing estimation procedures. In statistical decision theory, risk measures for which such verification and comparison is possible, are called elicitable. It is known that quantile\u2010based risk measures such as value at risk are elicitable. In this paper, the existing result of the nonelicitability of expected shortfall is extended to all law\u2010invariant spectral risk measures unless they reduce to minus the expected value. Hence, it is unclear how to perform forecast verification or comparison. However, the class of elicitable law\u2010invariant coherent risk measures does not reduce to minus the expected value. We show that it consists of certain expectiles.",

Sometimes this knowledge is well established through research, but often scientists must simply express their judgment, and this is particularly so in risk scenarios that are characterized by high levels of uncertainty. Usually in such cases, the opinions of several experts will be sought in order to pool knowledge and reduce error, raising the question of whether individual expert judgments should be given different weights. We argue\u2014against the commonly advocated \u201cclassical method\u201d\u2014that no significant benefits are likely to accrue from unequal weighting in mathematical aggregation. Our argument hinges on the difficulty of constructing reliable and valid measures of substantive expertise upon which to base weights. Practical problems associated with attempts to evaluate experts are also addressed. While our discussion focuses on one specific weighting scheme that is currently gaining in popularity for expert knowledge elicitation, our general thesis applies to externally imposed unequal weighting schemes more generally.",

This paper overviews critical variables, advantages, disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses of this tool, according to the ISO 31000 risk management framework. Results Risk assessment is one of the key stages in the Risk Management Process and involves specific steps: identifying hazards, analyzing and evaluating all possible risks. Several methods are developed to assess risks in the literature. A risk matrix method, also called \u201cdecision matrix risk assessment (DMRA) technique\u201d, is a systematic approach used to determine the risk level and to compare different risks and define which threats need to be controlled first. The actors involved in risk assessment are called on to manage different issues related to the choice of the most appropriate methodological approach, the assessment of the adequacy of the existing control measures, the articulation of risk consequence domains, the definition of the impact-consequences, the explanation of risk likelihood scales and the development of a risk matrix. Conclusion We highlighted a number of recommendations in order to address these issues, especially useful when healthcare organizations provide insufficient guidance on how to use risk matrices as well as what to do in response to the existing criticisms on their use.",

The commonly used measure of Holt and Laury (2002) relies on a dozen lottery choices and payments, which make it time consuming and expensive. It also raises moral concerns as a result of the unequal payments generated by good and bad luck. Paying some but not all subjects may also create tensions between the researcher and subjects. In a pre-registered study in Honduras, Nigeria and Spain, we use a short version of Holt and Laury where we address all three concerns. We find in the field that not paying at all or paying with and without probabilistic rules makes no difference. Our hypothetical and short version makes our measurement of risk cheaper, fairer and safer.",

In this paper we examine various factors that make it difficult to speak of the utility function for a given person. Similarly we show that it is questionable to pool data across studies (for descriptive purposes) that differ in the elicitation methods employed. \n \nThe following five sources of indeterminacy are specifically discussed. First, the certainty equivalence method generally yields more risk-seeking preferences than the probability equivalence method. Second, the probability and outcome levels used in reference lotteries induce systematic bias. Third, combining gain and loss domains yields different utility measures than separate examinations of the two domains. Fourth, whether a risk is assumed or transferred away exerts a significant influence on people's preferences in ways counter to expected utility theory. Finally, context or framing differences strongly affect choice in a non-normative manner. \n \nThe above five factors are first discussed as essential choices to be made by the decision scientist in constructing Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions. Next, each is examined separately in view of existing literature, and demonstrated via experiments. The emerging picture is that basic preferences under uncertainty exhibit serious incompatibilities with traditional expected utility theory. An important implication of this paper is to commence development of a systematic theory of utility encoding which incorporates the many information processing effects that influence people's expressed risk preferences.",

Scoring rules have been developed to provide ex ante incentives for careful and truthful assessments and ex post evaluation measures in the context of probability assessment. We show that these scoring rules designed for probability assessment provide inappropriate incentives if used for quantile assessment. We investigate the properties of a linear family of scoring rules that are intended specifically for quantile assessment (including the assessment of multiple quantiles) and can be related to a realistic decision-making problem. These rules provide proper incentives for quantile assessment and yield higher expected scores for distributions that are more informative in the sense of having less dispersion. We discuss the special case of interval forecasts and a generalization involving transformations, and we briefly mention other possible extensions.",

        "abstract": "Decision analysts are frequently called on to help inform decision makers in cases involving considerable uncertainty. In such situations, expert elicitation of parameter values is frequently used to supplement more conventional research. Expert elicitations typically rely on small panels of experts. However, in cases where the information needed for risk management must draw on a broad range of disciplines or types of professional backgrounds and experience, a larger, more heterogeneous expert panel is needed. In this paper we develop a formal protocol and a suite of uncertainty measures for this work. The protocol uses formal survey methods to take advantage of variation in individual expert uncertainty and heterogeneity among experts as a means of quantifying and comparing sources of uncertainty about parameters of interest. We illustrate the use of this protocol with an expert elicitation on the distribution of foodborne illness in the United States across foods. In the survey, experts are asked to attribute illnesses associated with one of eleven major foodborne pathogens to the consumption of one of eleven categories of food. Results show how the distributions of multiple measures of uncertainty (e.g., agreement of experts and uncertainty in knowledge), made feasible by use of a large panel of experts, can help identify which of several types of risk management actions may be most appropriate.",

Eric Bickel (both at the University of Texas at Austin) present a general connection between weighted proper scoring rules and investment decisions involving the minimization of a convex risk measure. Weighted scoring rules are quantitative tools for evaluating the accuracy of probabilistic forecasts relative to a baseline distribution. In their paper, the authors demonstrate that the relationship between convex risk measures and weighted scoring rules relates closely with previous economic characterizations of weighted scores based on expected utility maximization. As illustrative examples, the authors study two families of weighted scoring rules based on phi-divergences (generalizations of the Weighted Power and Weighted Pseudospherical Scoring rules) along with their corresponding risk measures. The paper will be of particular interest to the decision analysis and mathematical finance communities as well as those interested in the elicitation and evaluation of subjective probabilistic forecasts.",

We present data collected in controlled experiments with 2,939 subjects in 30 countries measuring risk and uncertainty attitudes through incentivized measures as well as survey questions. Our data show clearly that measures correlate not only within decision contexts or measurement methods, but also across contexts and methods. This points to the existence of one underlying \"risk preference\", which influences attitudes independently of the measurement method or choice domain. We furthermore find that answers to a general and a financial survey question correlate with incentivized lottery choices in most countries. Incentivized and survey measures also correlate significantly between countries. This opens the possibility to conduct cultural comparisons on risk attitudes using survey instruments.

Inferring a decision maker's utility function through assessments typically involves an elicitation phase where the decision maker responds to a series of elicitation queries, followed by an estimation phase where the state-of-the-art for direct elicitation approaches in practice is to either fit responses to a parametric form or perform linear interpolation. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric method involving Gaussian stochastic processes for estimating a utility function from direct elicitation responses. Advantages include the flexibility to fit a large class of functions, favorable theoretical properties, and a fully probabilistic view of the decision maker's preference properties including risk attitude. Through extensive simulation experiments as well as two real datasets from management science, we demonstrate that the proposed approach results in better function fitting.",

        "abstract": "Despite many claims for and against the use of risk comparisons in risk communication, few empirical studies have explored their effect. Only one study, published by Roth et al. in this journal in 1990, has tested the 1988 predictions by Covello et al. as to the public's relative preferences for 14 kinds of risk comparisons as they might be used by a factory manager to explain risks of his ethylene oxide plant. That study found no correlations between the Covello predictions and seven different measures of \u201cacceptability\u201d of Covello's examples of each type of comparison. However, two critics of the Roth study, as well as its own authors, suggested that a scenario involving local risks, a conflict\u2010ridden situation, and a plant manager unknown to the townspeople might better evoke Covello\u2010like preferences than the distant, calm, friends\u2010involving scenario used by Roth. The research reported here replicated the Roth study using the same scenario, risk comparison examples, and evaluation measures, and added a second scenario intended to replicate the conditions suggested by critics. Over 200 New Jersey residents answered the study questionnaire. The replication scenario reproduced Roth's results, and the conflict scenario also evoked no rankings correlated with Covello's predictions. Furthermore, neither agreement nor disagreement with five statements representing \u201cconflict\u201d\u2014respondents' reports that the industrial\u2010plant scenario made them angry, they lived near industry, they were concerned about industrial risks, people in their home town were angry about industrial pollution, and they worried \u201cfrequently\u201d about long\u2010term effects of pollution\u2014correlated with Covello's predictions. Over half of all ratings ascribed to the comparisons in aggregate were positive, and most detailed comments offered by respondents also were positive, despite many criticisms and suggestions for their improvement. The wide variability in individuals' rankings also undermines the notion of any single ranking of preferred comparisons. These findings have implications for use of risk comparisons, but also reveal the inaccuracy of the field's assumptions about public reaction to industrial risk information, including risk comparison.",

Researchers have developed several methods to account for the fact that the probability of an event may be more ambiguous for some respondents than others, but few prior studies have empirically compared the approaches. This article contrasts two of the most prominent methods using data from an experiment embedded in a recent Web survey of 926 volunteer panelists. Specifically, we comparatively evaluate the descriptive and relational properties of ambiguity scores obtained by placing follow-up questions after items eliciting expectations that ask either for (1) a range of probabilities that the respondent is confident to contain the true probability or for (2) a verbal response indicating assuredness. Our results show that these two methods produce measures that have more similarities than differences. Both methods yield ambiguity scores that (1) are not strongly associated with exposure to sources of relevant information, (2) are correlated across seemingly unrelated events, and (3) are consistently related to the level of reported risk.",

This argument is couched within the rubric of null hypothesis testing, which I suggest is a poor descriptive and normative model for risk assessment. Risk regulation is not primarily concerned with evaluating the probability of data conditional upon the null hypothesis, but rather with measuring risks, estimating the consequences of available courses of action and inaction, formally characterizing uncertainty, and deciding what to do based upon explicit values and decision criteria. In turn, I defend an ideal of value\u2010neutrality, whereby the core inferential tasks of risk assessment\u2014such as weighing evidence, estimating parameters, and model selection\u2014should be guided by the aim of correspondence to reality. This is not to say that value judgments be damned, but rather that they should be accounted for within a structured approach to decision analysis, rather than embedded within risk assessment in an informal manner.",

Our results confirm the recent literature that downplays the link between 2D:4D and many domains of economic interest, such as social and risk preferences. As for the former, we find that social preferences are significantly lower when 2D:4D is above the median value only for subjects with low cognitive ability. As for the latter, we find that a high 2D:4D is not correlated with the frequency of subjects' risky choices.",

The preference should not depend on the description of the options (description invariance) or on the method of elicitation (procedure invariance). In Experiment 1, the maximum buying price for the right to play some bets was compared to the minimum selling price for giving up the right to play those same gambles. The selling prices were significantly greater than the buying prices for the different bets. In Experiment 2 participants had a choice task between a sure option and a risky one. The diversification obtained through repeated gambles had the predicted effect of decreasing risk aversion in the choice task. However, participants gave higher prices and lower risk premiums for the single gamble than for the repeated gambles, suggesting that the single gamble was more attractive than the repeated gamble. These results are consistent with the reversal of preferences found in previous research.",

        "abstract": "Multiple price lists have emerged as a simple and popular method for eliciting risk preferences. Despite their popularity, a key downside of multiple price lists has not been widely recognized -namely that the approach is unlikely to generate sufficient information to accurately identify different dimensions of risk preferences. The most popular theories of decision making under risk posit that preference for risk are driven by a combination of two factors: the curvature of the utility function and the extent to which probabilities are weighted nonlinearly. In this paper, we show that the widely used multiple price list introduced by Holt and Laury (2002) is likely more accurate at eliciting the latter, and we introduce a different multiple price list that is likely more accurate at eliciting the former. We show that by combining information from different multiple price lists, greater predictive performance can be achieved.",

        "abstract": "This issue opens with an exchange of views on the logical implications of the \u201cPrecautionary Principle\u201d (PP) and its consistency, or lack of it, with normative principles for rational decision-making. The principle has been formulated in various ways since the 1992 Rio Declaration that \u201cWhere there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.\u201d Criticisms have ranged from the argument that the principle opposes a straw-man position (\u201cfull scientific certainty\u201d has never been a prerequisite for rational action in normative decision theories) to arguments that it is self-defeating (taking proposed actions might cause damage that the principle would forbid) or irrational, violating normative principles such as those of expected utility theory. The latter critique was formalized in a 2006 article by Peterson in Risk Analysis that pointed out that most version of the PP are mathematically inconsistent with normative decision-analytic principles of well-ordered (complete, asymmetric, and transitive) preferences for acts, selection of nondominated acts, and commensurability of preferences for outcomes\u2013\u2013the latter meaning roughly that no outcome is considered infinitely worse than others, in the sense that no increase in its probability, however, small, could be compensated by any increase in the probabilities of preferred outcomes, however, large. These are all implications of standard expected utility theory. In this issue, Boyer-Kassem challenges the normative significance of Peterson\u2019s result, objecting that it holds only if the decision-maker knows all the possible outcomes of decisions and all outcomes are commensurable. In his reply, Peterson counters that his results, like expected utility theory itself, do not require any such complete knowledge of possible outcomes, but only that preferences should be coherent (well ordered) whenever outcomes (currently known or not) are compared. Likewise, he argues that the other objections that Boyer-Kassem has raised, while providing useful clarity, can be met; and that the PP therefore remains incoherent, or at least inconsistent with expected utility theory and the usual axioms of rational decision-making that imply it. Boyer-Kassem responds, emphasizing that \u201cPeterson\u2019s theorem is limited to outcomes which are, in principle, comparable\u201d and that it only shows that the PP, by making some outcomes incomparably more important than others, is inconsistent with proposed normative principles for rational decision-making. He concludes that \u201cA better interpretation of the theorem is that it clarifies where PP departs from traditional decision theory,\u201d rather than demonstrating that it is incoherent in any larger sense.",

The randomized SRM (RSRM) allows one to describe the DM's\npreferences at different states with different SRMs. When the distribution of\nthe random parameter is known, i.e., the randomness of the DM's preference can\nbe described by a probability distribution, we introduce a new risk measure\nwhich is the mean value of the RSRM. In the case when the distribution is\nunknown, we propose a distributionally robust formulation of RSRM. The RSRM\nparadigm provides a new framework for interpreting the well-known Kusuoka's\nrepresentation of law invariant coherent risk measures and addressing\ninconsistency issues arising from observation/measurement errors or erroneous\nresponses in preference elicitation process. We discuss in detail computational\nschemes for solving optimization problems based on the RSRM and the\ndistributionally robust RSRM.",

Abstract: The Bayes linear methodology allows decision makers to express their subjective beliefs and adjust these beliefs as observations are made. It is similar in spirit to probabilistic Bayesian approaches, but differs as it uses expectation as its primitive. While substantial work has been carried out in Bayes linear analysis, both in terms of theory development and application, there is little published material on the elicitation of structured expert judgement to quantify models. This paper investigates different methods that could be used by analysts when creating an elicitation process. The theoretical underpinnings of the elicitation methods developed are explored and an evaluation of their use is presented. This work was motivated by, and is a precursor to, an industrial application of Bayes linear modelling of the reliability of defence systems. An illustrative example demonstrates how the methods can be used in practice.",

        "abstract": "The predictive performance of point forecasts for a statistical functional, such as the mean, a quantile, or a certain risk measure, is commonly assessed in terms of scoring (or loss) functions. A scoring functions should be (strictly) consistent for the functional of interest, that is, the expected score should be minimised by the correctly specified functional value. A functional is elicitable if it possesses a strictly consistent scoring function. In quantitative risk management, the elicitability of a risk measure is closely related to comparative backtesting procedures. As such, it has gained considerable interest in the debate about which risk measure to choose in practice. While this discussion has mainly focused on the dichotomy between Value at Risk (VaR) - a quantile - and Expected Shortfall (ES) - a tail expectation, this paper is concerned with Range Value at Risk (RVaR). RVaR can be regarded as an interpolation of VaR and ES, which constitutes a tradeoff between the sensitivity of the latter and the robustness of the former. Recalling that RVaR is not elicitable, we show that a triplet of RVaR with two VaR components at different levels is elicitable. We characterise the class of strictly consistent scoring functions. Moreover, additional properties of these scoring functions are examined, including the diagnostic tool of Murphy diagrams. The results are illustrated with a simulation study, and we put our approach in perspective with respect to the classical approach of trimmed least squares in robust regression",

While previous studies focus on measuring aggregate levels of betrayal aversion, the connection between an individual\u2019s own betrayal aversion and other individually varying factors, including risk preferences, are currently unexplored. This paper develops a new task to elicit an individual\u2019s level of betrayal aversion that can then be compared to individual characteristics. We demonstrate the feasibility of our new task and show that our aggregate individual results are consistent with previous studies. We then use this classification to ask whether betrayal aversion is correlated with risk aversion. While we find risk aversion and betrayal aversion have no significant relationship, we do observe that risk aversion is correlated with non-social risk preferences, but not the social, betrayal related, risk component of the new task.",

        "abstract": "This thesis studies two types of problems, the theory of risk functionals and the risk sharing problem. We put a special focus on a class of non-monotone law-invariant risk functionals, called the signed Choquet integrals.\r\nThe contribution can be seen as three portions.\r\nThe first portion of this thesis contains various results on signed Choquet integrals. A functional characterization via comonotonic additivity is established, along with some theoretical properties including six equivalent conditions for a signed Choquet integral to be convex. We proceed to address two practical issues currently popular in risk management, namely, robustness (continuity) issues and risk aggregation with dependence uncertainty, for signed Choquet integrals. Our results generalize in several directions those in the literature of risk functionals. From the results obtained in this chapter, we see that many existing elegant mathematical results in the theory of risk measures hold for the general class of signed Choquet integrals; thus they do not rely on the assumption of monotonicity.\r\nIn the second portion, we analyze the \u201cconvex level sets\u201d (CxLS) property of risk functionals, which is a necessary condition for the notions of elicitability, identifiability, and backtestability, popular in the recent statistics and risk management literature. We put the CxLS property in the context of multi-dimensional risk functionals. We obtain two main analytical results in dimension one and dimension two, by characterizing the CxLS property of all one-dimensional signed Choquet integrals, and that of all two-dimensional signed Choquet integrals with a quantile component. Using these results, we proceed to show that a comonotonic-additive coherent risk measure is co-elicitable with a Value-at- Risk if and only if it is a convex combination of the mean and the corresponding Expected Shortfall. The new findings generalize several results in the recent literature and partially answer an open question on the characterization of multi-dimensional elicitability.\r\nIn the third portion, we study a risk sharing problem. Unlike classic risk sharing problems based on expected utilities or convex risk measures, quantile-based risk sharing problems exhibit two special features. First, quantile-based risk measures (such as the Value-at-Risk) are often not convex, and second, they ignore some part of the distribution of the risk. These features create technical challenges in establishing a full characterization of optimal allocations, a question left unanswered in the literature. In this paper, we address the issues on the existence and the characterization of (Pareto-)optimal allocations in quantile-based risk sharing problems. It turns out that negative dependence, mutual exclusivity in particular, plays an important role in the optimal allocations, in contrast to positive dependence appearing in classic risk sharing problems. As a by-product of our main finding, we obtain some results on the optimization of the Value-at-Risk and the Expected Shortfall",

This view\nis mathematically appealing and natural because of the affine structure of the\nspace of probability measures. Behavioural economists and psychologists, on the\nother hand, have demonstrated that humans consistently violate the EU postulate\nby switching from risk-averse to risk-taking behaviour. This paradox has led to\nthe development of descriptive theories of decisions, such as the celebrated\nprospect theory, which uses an $S$-shaped value function with concave and\nconvex branches explaining the observed asymmetry. Although successful in\nmodelling human behaviour, these theories appear to contradict the natural set\nof axioms behind the EU postulate. Here we show that the observed asymmetry in\nbehaviour can be explained if, apart from utilities of the outcomes, rational\nagents also value information communicated by random events. We review the main\nideas of the classical value of information theory and its generalizations.\nThen we prove that the value of information is an $S$-shaped function, and that\nits asymmetry does not depend on how the concept of information is defined, but\nfollows only from linearity of the expected utility. Thus, unlike many\ndescriptive and `non-expected' utility theories that abandon the linearity\n(i.e. the `independence' axiom), we formulate a rigorous argument that the von\nNeumann and Morgenstern rational agents should be both risk-averse and\nrisk-taking if they are not indifferent to information.",

        "abstract": "This thesis studies two types of problems, the theory of risk functionals and the risk sharing problem. We put a special focus on a class of non-monotone law-invariant risk functionals, called the signed Choquet integrals. The contribution can be seen as three portions. The first portion of this thesis contains various results on signed Choquet integrals. A functional characterization via comonotonic additivity is established, along with some theoretical properties including six equivalent conditions for a signed Choquet integral to be convex. We proceed to address two practical issues currently popular in risk management, namely, robustness (continuity) issues and risk aggregation with dependence uncertainty, for signed Choquet integrals. Our results generalize in several directions those in the literature of risk functionals. From the results obtained in this chapter, we see that many existing elegant mathematical results in the theory of risk measures hold for the general class of signed Choquet integrals; thus they do not rely on the assumption of monotonicity. In the second portion, we analyze the \u201cconvex level sets\u201d (CxLS) property of risk functionals, which is a necessary condition for the notions of elicitability, identifiability, and backtestability, popular in the recent statistics and risk management literature. We put the CxLS property in the context of multi-dimensional risk functionals. We obtain two main analytical results in dimension one and dimension two, by characterizing the CxLS property of all one-dimensional signed Choquet integrals, and that of all two-dimensional signed Choquet integrals with a quantile component. Using these results, we proceed to show that a comonotonic-additive coherent risk measure is co-elicitable with a Value-atRisk if and only if it is a convex combination of the mean and the corresponding Expected Shortfall. The new findings generalize several results in the recent literature and partially answer an open question on the characterization of multi-dimensional elicitability. In the third portion, we study a risk sharing problem. Unlike classic risk sharing problems based on expected utilities or convex risk measures, quantile-based risk sharing problems exhibit two special features. First, quantile-based risk measures (such as the Value-at-Risk) are often not convex, and second, they ignore some part of the distribution of the risk. These features create technical challenges in establishing a full characterization of optimal allocations, a question left unanswered in the literature. In this paper, we address the issues on the existence and the characterization of (Pareto-)optimal allocations in quantile-based risk sharing problems. It turns out that negative dependence, mutual exclusivity in particular, plays an important role in the optimal allocations, in contrast to positive dependence appearing in classic risk sharing problems.

Such scoring functions are called strictly consistent for the functional. The elicitability of a functional opens the possibility to compare competing forecasts and to rank them in terms of their realized scores. In this paper, we explore the notion of elicitability for multi-dimensional functionals and give both necessary and suf\ufb01cient conditions for strictly consistent scoring functions. We cover the case of functionals with elicitable components, but we also show that one-dimensional functionals that are not elicitable can be a component of a higher order elicitable functional. In the case of the variance, this is a known result. However, an important result of this paper is that spectral risk measures with a spectral measure with \ufb01nite support are jointly elicitable if one adds the \u201ccorrect\u201d quantiles. A direct consequence of applied interest is that the pair (Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall) is jointly elicitable under mild conditions that are usually ful\ufb01lled in risk management applications.",

In order to assess forecasting performance of a risk measurement procedure, risk measure forecasts are compared to the realized financial losses over a period of time and a statistical test of correctness of the procedure is conducted. This process is known as backtesting. Such traditional backtests are concerned with assessing some optimality property of a set of risk measure estimates. However, they are not suited to compare different risk estimation procedures. We investigate the proposal of comparative backtests, which are better suited for method comparisons on the basis of forecasting accuracy, but necessitate an elicitable risk measure. The discussion focuses on three risk measures, value-at-risk, expected shortfall and expectiles, and is supported by a simulation study and data analysis.",

For the majority of subjects, we find that risk preferences are not stable across elicitation methods. In interval regression models, subjects' risk preference classifications from survey questions on job-based gambles are not associated with risk preference estimates from the experiment. However, we find that risk classifications from inheritance-based gambles are significantly associated with the experimental measure. We identify some subjects for whom risk preference estimates are more strongly correlated across elicitation methods, suggesting that unobserved subject traits like comprehension or effort influence risk preference stability.

SDR combines\nExpected Shortfall (ES) and Shortfall Deviation (SD), which we also introduce,\ncontemplating two fundamental pillars of the risk concept, the probability of\nadverse events and the variability of an expectation, and considers extreme\nresults. We demonstrate that SD is a generalized deviation measure, whereas SDR\nis a coherent risk measure. We achieve the dual representation of SDR, and we\ndiscuss issues such as its representation by a weighted ES, acceptance sets,\nconvexity, continuity and the relationship with stochastic dominance.\nIllustrations with real and simulated data allow us to conclude that SDR offers\ngreater protection in risk measurement compared with VaR and ES, especially in\ntimes of significant turbulence in riskier scenarios.",

Other\nrisk measures, among them the most important risk measure---the Average\nValue-at-Risk---are well defined on the larger space L^1 and this seems to be\nthe natural domain space for this risk measure. Spectral risk measures\nconstitute a further class of risk measures of central importance, and they are\noften considered on some L^p space. But in many situations this is possibly\nunnatural, because any L^p with p>p_0, say, is suitable to define the spectral\nrisk measure as well. In addition to that risk measures have also been\nconsidered on Orlicz and Zygmund spaces. So it remains for discussion and\nclarification, what the natural domain to consider a risk measure is? Abstract\nThis paper introduces a norm, which is built from the risk measure, and a\nBanach space, which carries the risk measure in a natural way. It is often\nstrictly larger than its original domain, and obeys the key property that the\nrisk measure is finite valued and continuous on that space in an elementary and\nnatural way.",

The main result is that the only risk measures that satisfy a set of economic axioms for the Choquet expected utility and the statistical property of general elicitability (i.e., there exists an objective function such that minimizing the expected objective function yields the risk measure) are the mean functional and value-at-risk (VaR), in particular the median shortfall, which is the median of tail loss distribution and is also the VaR at a higher confidence level. We also discuss various approaches of backtesting and their relations to elicitability and co-elicitability; in particular, we show that the co-elicitability of VaR and expected shortfall does not lead to a reliable backtesting method for expected shortfall and there have been only indirect backtesting methods for expected shortfall. Furthermore, we extend the result to address model uncertainty by incorporating multiple scenarios. As an application, we argue that median shortfall is a better alternative than expected shortfall for setting capital requirements in Basel Accords.",

We also show that well-established\nsolutions to the CRM problem like sample variance penalization schemes are\nspecial instances of a more general DRO problem. In this unifying framework, a\nvariety of distributionally robust counterfactual risk estimators can be\nconstructed using various probability distances and divergences as uncertainty\nmeasures. We propose the use of Kullback-Leibler divergence as an alternative\nway to model uncertainty in CRM and derive a new robust counterfactual\nobjective. In our experiments, we show that this approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art on four benchmark datasets, validating the relevance of using\nother uncertainty measures in practical applications.",

For what we call the infimum of expectations class of\nrisk measures, we show that if the decision maker (DM) maximizes the\nexpectation of a random return under constraint that the risk measure is\nbounded above, he then behaves as a ``generalized expected utility maximizer''\nin the following sense. The DM exhibits ambiguity with respect to a family of\nutility functions defined on a larger set of decisions than the original one;\nhe adopts pessimism and performs first a minimization of expected utility over\nthis family, then performs a maximization over a new decisions set. This\neconomic behaviour is called ``Maxmin under risk'' and studied by Maccheroni\n(2002).

The implicit assumption behind proper scoring rules is that agents are risk neutral. Such an assumption is often unrealistic when agents are human beings. Modern theories of choice under uncertainty based on rank-dependent utilities assert that human beings weight nonlinear utilities using decision weights, which are differences between weighting functions applied to cumulative probabilities.In this paper, I investigate the reporting behavior of an agent with a rank-dependent utility when he is rewarded using a proper scoring rule tailored to his utility function. I show that such an agent misreports his true belief by reporting a vector of decision weights. My findings thus highlight the risk of utilizing proper scoring rules without prior knowledge about all the components that drive an agent's attitude towards uncertainty. On the positive side, I discuss how tailored proper scoring rules can effectively elicit weighting functions. Moreover, I show how to obtain an agent's true belief from his misreported belief once the weighting functions are known.",

The approach seeks perceptions of control and concern over a large risk set and the elicitation method is structured so as to reduce the cognitive burden typically associated with ranking over large sets. The BWS approach is designed to yield strong discrimination over items. Further, the approach permits derivation of individual\u2010level values, in this case of perceptions of control and worry, and analysis of how these vary over observable characteristics, through estimation of random parameter logit models. The approach is implemented for a set of 20 food and nonfood risks. The results show considerable heterogeneity in perceptions of control and worry, that the degree of heterogeneity varies across the risks, and that women systematically consider themselves to have less control over the risks than men.",

A key\nchallenge in ensuring explainability is its dependence on the specific human\nuser (\"explainee\").

Our main contribution is the\nexplainable empirical risk minimization (EERM) principle of learning a\nhypothesis that optimally balances between the subjective explainability and\nrisk.

Following Gigerenzer's view of ecological rationality, the authors argue an individual's personal value system serves as concrete motivations that guide risky choices and facilitate adaptation to one's environment.Design/methodology/approachThe authors elicit risk attitudes using a satisficing-based risk elicitation method that exploits the idea of worst-case aspiration or minimum portfolio returns given a portfolio comprising a safe and risky prospect. The elicited worst-case aspiration allows for more descriptive and natural ways of characterizing attitudes to risk (i.e. satisficing measures of risk). Using the Schwartz Value Survey, the authors assess the relative importance individuals place on value systems, such as personal focus versus social focus. The authors argue that preference to value systems has linkages with the worst-case aspiration setting emphasized in the satisficing task.FindingsThis study\u2019s findings suggest that individuals who are willing to give up higher potential returns to protect their downside risk (by setting higher worst-case aspiration) are positively associated with personal focus\u2014concern about own outcomes than social focus\u2014concern about the outcomes for others or established institutions.Research limitations/implicationsCurrently, the study\u2019s setting is in the domain of financial decision-making. Going forward, milestones could be set for studying risky real-world choices by simply changing the risk measure in different contexts, such as job choices, education, health and social interactions.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the discussion on the psychometric structure of risk. Prescriptive benefits of satisficing as a positive heuristic, which is interpreted as setting achievable goals or aspiration levels, are extensive and recognized in various industries ranging from agriculture, airlines, insurance to financial advising. More recently, cognitive processes, such as emotions and personal value systems, are recognized as a type of social cognition that subserve heuristic functions that can guide behavior quickly and accurately.",

In particular, we test for correlation of the elicited degrees of monetary risk aversion at a within-subject level. We show that sufficiently similar incentivized mechanisms elicit correlated decisions in terms of monetary risk aversion only if other risk-related attitudes are accounted for. Furthermore, we ask subjects to self-report their general willingness to take risks. We find evidence of some external validity of the two tasks as predictors of self-reported risk attitudes in general human domains.",

We consider the choice of fairness metrics\nthrough the lens of metric elicitation -- a principled framework for selecting\nperformance metrics that best reflect implicit preferences. The use of metric\nelicitation enables a practitioner to tune the performance and fairness metrics\nto the task, context, and population at hand. Specifically, we propose a novel\nstrategy to elicit group-fair performance metrics for multiclass classification\nproblems with multiple sensitive groups that also includes selecting the\ntrade-off between predictive performance and fairness violation. The proposed\nelicitation strategy requires only relative preference feedback and is robust\nto both finite sample and feedback noise.",

In an experiment (n = 1,730), we elicit measures of utility curvature, probability weighting, loss aversion, and preference for certainty and use them to parameterize seventeen common structural models (e.g., expected utility, cumulative prospect theory). Subjects also make twelve insurance choices over different loss probabilities and prices. The insurance choices show coherence and some correlation with various risk-attitude measures.

Simpler prediction heuristics show more promise for predicting insurance choices across different conditions.",

In this paper, we examine the validity of stated risks elicited via the EM by using a laboratory experiment. The risk under study is the presence of pesticide residues in apples. Taking inspiration from the de Finetti\u2019s notion of coherence, we consider risk measures as valid if and only if they obey all axioms and theorems of probability theory. Our experiment consists of four treatments: in the first, subjects are provided with real monetary incentives, but in the second, they are not. Each experimental group is further sub-divided in two groups, in the first, the chained structure of the experimental design made quite clear to the subjects, while, in the second, the chained structure is hidden by resorting the elicitation questions. We found that the beneficial effect of real monetary incentives on the validity of stated risk estimates is completely vanished when people are presented with chained experimental design.",

Our measurement is parameter-free in the sense that it requires no assumptions about the shape of the functions reflecting utility and regret. The choice of stimuli was such that event-splitting effects could not confound our results. Our findings were largely consistent with the assumptions of regret theory although some deviations were observed. These deviations can be explained by psychological heuristics and referencedependence of preferences.",

It follows that the only risk measure that is both coherent and elicitable is an Expectile based risk measure. But unlike the VaR measure, the Expectile does not meet the criterion of comonotonic additivity. Taking this result into account, this paper proposes Expectile conditioned by a VaR as a risk measure. \n \nThen, the principle of elicitability has been used to perform backtesting and comparative analysis of the performance of the new measure versus VaR and Expectile. \n \nTwo kinds of conditioning have been retained, Expectile conditioned to a predictive VaR (CEVaR) and Expectile conditioned to a realized VaR (CRVaR) as alternative risk measures. \n \nThe Monte Carlo simulation and historical simulation methods were implemented to assess the validity of the two risk measures CEVaR and CRVaR. The evaluation was carried out in terms of: \n \n- Precision: for this purpose, the backtesting functions associated with the risk measures have been used; \n \n- Sub-additivity and comonotonic additivity. \n \nThe simulations showed that the CRVaR and CEVaR measures are more accurate than the Expectile and VaR measures but CEVaR is not stable when the historical simulation method is used. A numerical assessment of sub-additivity and comonotonic additivity showed that CRVaR is sub-additive while CEVAR is not and both are not comonotonic additive. Nevertheless, we could conclude that CRVAR is a valid alternative to VaR as it\u2019s coherent and outperforms Expetile in terms of accuracy.",

Extant approaches for the elicitation of these two key ingredients of individuals' risk attitude typically rely on a long, chained sequence of lottery choices. In contrast, preferred outcome distributions can be elicited through an intuitive graphical interface, and, as we show, the information contained in two preferred outcome distributions is sufficient to identify non-parametrically both the value function and the probability weighting function in rank-dependent utility models. To illustrate our method and its advantages, we run an incentive-compatible lab study in which participants use a simple graphical interface -the Distribution Builder (Goldstein et al. 2008) -to construct their preferred outcome distributions, subject to a budget constraint. Results show that estimates of the value function are in line with previous research but that probability weighting biases are diminished, thus favoring our proposed approach based on preferred outcome distributions.",

        "abstract": "Information security professionals have to assess risk in order to make investment decisions on security measures. To investigate whether professionals make such decisions unbiased and rationally, we conducted an economic online experiment and survey measuring risk attitude of security professionals and contrasting their behaviour with the general population. Participants were asked to state their willingness-to-pay in order to avoid a series of losses-only lotteries and to make choices between such lotteries. We also devised a mechanism to elicit preferences between security and operability. Our findings suggest that security professionals are risk and ambiguity averse, consider small losses inevitable and take risks when losses are associated with large probabilities. We find that their preferences are measurably different from those of the general population in some of these aspects. We also find that job position influences security and operability preferences and that avoidance of salient (catastrophic) outcomes explains some of the professionals' behaviour. Moreover, professionals are susceptible to framing effects to the same extent as the general population, and reveal distorted probability perception, factors that are usually overlooked in risk assessment methodologies.",

Subjects decide how many boxes to collect out of 100, one of which containing a bomb. Earnings increase linearly with the number of boxes accumulated but are zero if the bomb is also collected. The BRET requires minimal numeracy skills, avoids truncation of the data, allows to precisely estimate both risk aversion and risk seeking, and is not affected by the degree of loss aversion or by violations of the Reduction Axiom. We validate the BRET and test its robustness in a large-scale experiment, although the task can be performed in the field as well. Choices react significantly to the stakes and to the size of the choice set. Our experiment rationalizes the gender gap that often characterizes choices under uncertainty by means of a higher loss rather than risk aversion. JEL Classifications: C81; C91; D81.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Many empirical studies that inform research, policy and practice surrounding hazards and risk and concerned with how members of the public perceive risk. However, these studies often assess perceived risk using a diverse range of either very general measures or measures of specific subsidiary concepts (for instance, the severity of consequences or the likelihood of occurrence). Previous research by Wilson and others has suggested that perceived risk is best understood and measured as a multidimensional construct that includes beliefs about the likelihood and severity of consequences and the feelings or affect elicited by the hazard. The research presented here extends the work of Wilson et al. by separating the likelihood of consequences into two components that denote the likelihood of the occurrence of a hazard (exposure) and the likelihood of experiencing consequences given exposure (susceptibility). This research replicates findings from Wilson et al. that perceived risk is best conceived of as a multidimensional construct and that affective responses are a primary driver of holistic judgments of both personal and general risk across a variety of hazards. We find that perceptions of susceptibility explain unique variance in holistic judgments of risk, however the importance of the susceptibility concept differs across hazards and across judgments of personal and general risk. These results suggest that measures of susceptibility can meaningfully increase our ability to understand the beliefs that underlie perceptions of the risk posed by a diverse range of hazards. This suggests that developing measures including susceptibility can provide unique opportunities to improve risk communication and risk management policy outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Science-based models often involve substantial uncertainty that must be quantified in a defendable way. Shortage of empirical data inevitably requires input from expert judgment. How this uncertainty is best elicited can be critical to a decision process, as differences in efficacy and robustness of the elicitation methods can be substantial. When performed rigorously, expert elicitation and pooling of experts' opinions can be powerful means for obtaining rational estimates of uncertainty. Causes of uncertainty may be interrelated and may introduce dependencies. Ignoring these dependencies may lead to large errors. Dependence modelling is an active research topic, and methods for dependence elicitation are still very much under development. Dependence measures such as rank correlations are commonly used in different types of models. Eliciting rank correlations and conditional rank correlations from experts have been proposed and used in the past. Conditional rank correlations are not elicited directly from experts, rather the experts are asked to estimate some other related quantities. In this paper two methods for eliciting conditional rank correlations via related quantities are compared in order to obtain insight about which of the two renders more accurate estimates of conditional rank correlations. Our data shows that good performance in uncertainty assessments does not automatically translates into good performance in dependence estimates. We show that, analogously to uncertainty estimates, combining experts' estimates of dependence according to their performance results in better estimates of the dependence structure.",

This paper reports the first phase of a research effort to combine disparate formal methods of expert elicitation into a streamlined method. Fourteen reliability analysts were interviewed to identify current practices in expert elicitation.",

Abstract: There is a large literature showing that willingness-to-accept (WTA) is usually much higher than willingness-to-pay (WTP) in empirical studies although they should be roughly equal according to traditional economic theory. A second stream of literature shows that people are typically ambiguity averse, i.e. they prefer lotteries with known probabilities over lotteries with unknown ones. Our study combines both streams of literature and analyzes whether there is an interaction between the WTP-WTA disparity and ambiguity aversion.",

Subjects decide how many boxes to collect out of 100, one of which containing a bomb. Earnings increase linearly with the number of boxes accumulated but are zero if the bomb is also collected. The BRET requires minimal numeracy skills, avoids truncation of the data, allows to precisely estimate both risk aversion and risk seeking, and is not affected by the degree of loss aversion or by violations of the Reduction Axiom. We validate the task and test its robustness in a large-scale experiment. Choices react significantly to the stakes and to the size of the choice set. Our experiment rationalizes the gender gap that often characterizes choices under uncertainty by means of a higher loss rather than risk aversion.",

        "abstract": "We elicit individual preferences over social risk. We identify the extent to which these preferences are correlated with individual preferences over individual risk and individual preferences over the well-being of others. We examine these preferences in the context of laboratory experiments over small, anonymous groups, although the methodological issues extend to larger groups that form endogenously (e.g., families, committees, communities). We find that social risk attitudes can be closely approximated by individual risk attitudes. We find no evidence that subjects systematically reveal different risk attitudes in a social setting compared to when they solely bear the consequences individually. All three tasks are undertaken for the same subjects: elicitation of individual risk preferences, altruistic preferences, and social risk preferences. We also collect information on individual characteristics, to help us control for sampling heterogeneity in the assignment to treatment and identify differences in our conclusions associated with observable characteristics. We also consider the possibility that the social risk preferences of subjects depend on the expected individual risk attitude of others. This is a possibility whether or not subjects are altruistic, if, for example, they are concerned about social visibility and simply do not want to appear different from others. For example, if I am extremely risk loving when it comes to decisions for which I am the only one to bear the consequences, I might want to behave in a risk neutral or risk averse way when paired with people that I expect are significantly less risk loving. But I may not know this about the risk attitudes of others. Thus we consider one treatment in which subjects are provided information on the individual risk preferences of the others in their group before they are all asked to vote for a risk preference for the group. We find that elicited social risk attitudes closely track individual risk attitudes. Using an insample experimental design, and responses from 108 subjects in laboratory experiments that were conducted at the University of Los Andes in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, we do not detect any systematic differences between the two. Our design controls for order effects, informational effects, and variations in individual characteristics across treatments. We also find that social risk attitudes are generally risk averse, consistent with previous evidence on individual risk aversion in the laboratory here and elsewhere. 1 Apart from the positive significance of eliciting social risk attitudes, the possibility of differences between social and individual risk attitudes has long-standing normative significance. In the tradition of Arrow [1973; p.256/7], Howe and Roemer [1981; p.885] characterize the choice between a Rawlsian conception of justice and Harsanyi's prescription for justice in terms of",

        "abstract": "In an age in which humanity produces increasingly more data, information security is of critical importance. Risk, ambiguity and uncertainty are inherent features of information security, as potential threats can be known, imperfectly known or unknown. Information security professionals have to assess risk and consequently decide on protective and corrective measures for treating this risk. We investigate whether professionals make such decisions optimally, in an objective way. In order to do so, we conduct online experiments and surveys measuring perception and attitudes of security professionals towards risk. Participants are asked to state their willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid a series of losses-only lotteries, make choices between such lotteries and state their preferences over risk treatment actions. We examine professionals\u2019 behaviour in these lotteries as well as in security scenarios and conclude that security professionals do not minimise expected losses and cannot be considered as rational decision-makers. We also contrast professionals\u2019 behaviour to that of a sample of university students and show that their preferences are measurably different in several respects. Both samples are found to be susceptible to inconsistencies between WTP and choice decisions. Risk attitude of participants is found to depend on the probability level of potential losses. We devise a mechanism to elicit professionals\u2019 preferences between security and operability and find that the nature of their employment influences these preferences. Our findings suggest that security professionals are risk and ambiguity averse and are susceptible to framing effects when assessing and treating risk. Distinct preferences over risk treatment actions are also detected. We interview renowned experts from the industry and academia about the implications of these findings. We conclude that these factors, being usually overlooked in risk assessment and treatment methodologies, need to be taken into consideration for the development of objective and unbiased risk management. Finally, we discuss implications and recommend approaches for de-biasing decision-making.",

In four experiments (including more than 1,300 subjects), we systematically studied the effects of boredom on economic risk preferences. Across different risk elicitation tasks, boredom inductions, incentive schemes, subject pools, and using both reduced form and structural analyses, we consistently failed to find an effect of boredom on risky decisions. Our results disprove that boredom leads to even small increments in risk taking in one-shot elicitation tasks, and small to medium increases in multiple-choice elicitations. These findings question an important established belief, contribute to better understand the consequences of boredom, and have substantive implications for experiments on economic decision making.",

Participants typically make ten decisions with different variance options, with one of these choices randomly chosen for actual payoff. For this mechanism to provide an accurate measure of risk aversion, participants need to understand the choices and give consistent responses. Unfortunately, inconsistent and even dominated choices are often made. Can these mistakes lead to a misrepresentation of economic phenomena? We use gender differences in risk taking to test this question. In contrast to many findings in the literature, HL results typically do not find significant gender differences. We compare the HL approach, where we replicate the lack of significant gender differences, with a simpler presentation of the same choices in which participants make only one of the ten HL decisions; this simpler presentation yields strong gender differences indicating that women are more risk averse than men. We also find gender differences in the consistency of decisions. We believe that the results found in the simpler case are more reflective of underlying preferences, since the task is considerably easier to understand. Our results suggest that the complexity and structure of the risk elicitation mechanism can affect measured risk preferences. The issue of complexity and comprehension is also likely to be present with elicitation mechanisms in other realms of economic preferences.",

In\ncontrast to the classic worst-case risk (WR) approach, the MA approach produces\nnot only a robust value of risk evaluation but also a robust distributional\nmodel which is useful for modeling, analysis and simulation, independent of any\nspecific risk measure. The MA approach is easy to implement even if the\nuncertainty set is non-convex or the risk measure is computationally\ncomplicated, and it provides great tractability in distributionally robust\noptimization. Via an equivalence property between the MA and the WR approaches,\nnew axiomatic characterizations are obtained for a few classes of popular risk\nmeasures. In particular, the Expected Shortfall (ES, also known as CVaR) is the\nunique risk measure satisfying the equivalence property for convex uncertainty\nsets among a very large class. The MA approach for Wasserstein and\nmean-variance uncertainty sets admits explicit formulas for the obtained robust\nmodels, and the new approach is illustrated with various risk measures and\nexamples from portfolio optimization.",

We would also like to thank Peter Ouzounov for his assistance during the design and implementation of the experiments and Pierre Ngom, Assane Thioune, and Seydou Tandjigora for their assistance during the execution of the experiments. ABSTRACT In the past decade, it has become increasingly common to use simple laboratory games and decision tasks as a device for measuring both the preferences and understanding of rural populations in the developing world. This is vitally important for policy implementation in a variety of areas. In this paper, we report the results observed using three distinct risk elicitation mechanisms, using samples drawn from the rural population in Senegal, West Africa. Whatever the intellectual merits of a particular elicitation strategy, there is little value in performing such tests if the respondents do not understand the questions involved. We test the understanding of and the level of meaningful responses to the typical Holt-Laury task, to a simple binary mechanism pioneered by Gneezy and Potters in 1997 and adapted by Charness and Gneezy in 2010, and to a nonincentivized willingness-to-risk scale \u00e0 la Dohmen et al. We find a disturbingly low level of understanding with the Holt-Laury task and an unlikely-to-be-accurate pattern with the willingness-to-risk question. On the other hand, the simple binary mechanism produces results that closely match the patterns found in previous work, although the levels of risk-taking are lower than in previous studies. Our study is a cautionary note against utilizing either sophisticated risk-elicitation mechanisms at the possible cost of seriously diminished levels of comprehension or nonincentivized questions in the rural developing world.",

We propose a new concept: intrinsic risk measures and argue that this approach provides a direct path from unacceptable positions towards the acceptance set. Intrinsic risk measures use only internal resources and return the smallest percentage of the currently held financial position which has to be sold and reinvested into an eligible asset such that the resulting position becomes acceptable. While avoiding the problem of infinite values, intrinsic risk measures allow a free choice of the eligible asset and they preserve desired properties such as monotonicity and quasi-convexity. A dual representation on convex acceptance sets is derived and the link of intrinsic risk measures to their monetary counterparts on cones is detailed.",

Subjects decide how many boxes to collect out of 100, one of which contains a bomb. Earnings increase linearly with the number of boxes accumulated but are zero if the bomb is also collected. The BRET requires minimal numeracy skills, avoids truncation of the data, allows the precise estimation of both risk aversion and risk seeking, and is not affected by the degree of loss aversion or by violations of the Reduction Axiom. We validate the BRET, test its robustness in a large-scale experiment, and compare it to three popular risk elicitation tasks. Choices react significantly only to increased stakes, and are sensible to wealth effects. Our experiment rationalizes the gender gap that often characterizes choices under uncertainty by means of a higher loss rather than risk aversion.",

Using eight decision-making contexts ranging in familiarity, complexity, and risk, we show that a nationally representative sample (n\u2009=\u20091874) of respondents made choices that were inconsistent across two complimentary methods of eliciting preferences. We show that on average individuals demonstrate higher levels of internal consistency, or alignment between their choices and their stated values and concerns, when decisions are \u2018easy\u2019, or simple, familiar, and have little risk. However, this consistency declines when people are confronted with difficult choices involving unfamiliar, complex contexts involving high risk. Moreover, providing additional and salient contextual information about alternatives, such as brand names, model information, or the specific components of a risk mitigation strategy, results in significantly lower levels of consistency when compared to situations where this information is withheld. This finding suggests that people rely on simplifying heuristics when making easy decisions; however, this kind of information is less influential when choices are difficult. Importantly, we show that higher levels of education also have a significant and positive association with the consistency of people\u2019s choices.",

For input factors that are statistically dependent, we argue that a stress on one input should also precipitate stresses in other input factors. We introduce a novel sensitivity measure, termed cascade sensitivity, defined as a derivative of a risk measure applied on the output, in the direction of an input factor. The derivative is taken after suitably transforming the random vector of inputs, thus explicitly capturing the direct impact of the stressed input factor, as well as indirect effects via other inputs. Furthermore, alternative representations of the cascade sensitivity measure are derived, allowing us to address practical issues, such as incomplete specification of the model and high computational costs. The applicability of the methodology is illustrated through the analysis of a commercially used insurance risk model.",

As this risk measure has to be estimated from historical data, it is important to be able to verify and compare competing estimation procedures. In statistical decision theory, risk measures for which such verification and comparison is possible, are called elicitable. It is known that quantile based risk measures such as value at risk are elicitable. In this paper, Gneiting\u2019s (2011) result of the non-elicitability of expected shortfall is extended to all law-invariant spectral risk measures unless they reduce to minus the expected value. Hence, it is unclear how to perform forecast verification or comparison. However, the class of elicitable law-invariant coherent risk measures does not reduce to minus the expected value. We show that it consists of certain expectiles.",

This paper re\u2010examines this fundamental concept, studies and extends its main properties, and puts it in perspective to recent concepts of risk measures. We show that the negative of the OCE naturally provides a wide family of risk measures that fits the axiomatic formalism of convex risk measures. Duality theory is used to reveal the link between the OCE and the \u03d5\u2010divergence functional (a generalization of relative entropy), and allows for deriving various variational formulas for risk measures. Within this interpretation of the OCE, we prove that several risk measures recently analyzed and proposed in the literature (e.g., conditional value of risk, bounded shortfall risk) can be derived as special cases of the OCE by using particular utility functions. We further study the relations between the OCE and other certainty equivalents, providing general conditions under which these can be viewed as coherent/convex risk measures. Throughout the paper several examples illustrate the flexibility and adequacy of the OCE for building risk measures.",

In RISK research, however, there is no standard measure for subjective probability estimates. In this study, we compared five commonly used measurement formats\u2014two rating scales, a visual analog scale, and two numeric measures\u2014in terms of their ability to assess subjective probability judgments when objective probabilities are available. We varied the probabilities (low vs. moderate) and severity (low vs. high) of the events to be judged as well as the presentation mode of objective probabilities (sequential presentation of singular events vs. graphical presentation of aggregated information). We employed two complementary goodness\u2010of\u2010fit criteria: the correlation between objective and subjective probabilities (sensitivity), and the root mean square deviations of subjective probabilities from objective values (accuracy). The numeric formats generally outperformed all other measures. The severity of events had no effect on the performance. Generally, a rise in probability led to decreases in performance. This effect, however, depended on how the objective probabilities were encoded: pictographs ensured perfect information, which improved goodness of fit for all formats and diminished this negative effect on the performance. Differences in performance between scales are thus caused only in part by characteristics of the scales themselves\u2014they also depend on the process of encoding. Consequently, researchers should take the source of probability information into account before selecting a measure.",

We find evidence for risk aversion, prudence, and temperance. These traits correlate within subjects. The compensations elicited for prudence are significantly larger than those for risk aversion and temperance. In contrast to commonly used utility functions, prospect theory can predict this behavioral pattern. In our experiment, risk-averse, risk-loving, and risk-neutral subjects are prudent. This supports a recent theoretical observation that prudence may be a more universal trait than previously realized.",

Economic theory, however, is silent on their use as a predictive metric for ascertaining why individuals exhibit a particular risk preference. Insight as to the possible drivers of why individuals exhibit a given risk preference may lie in the cognitive and noncognitive characteristics embodied in an individual. The key hypothesis of the proposed effort is to ascertain if a correlation between risk and personality exists and, if so, to what extent do certain traits influence risk preference. The findings of this study show indicate no statistical relationship between intelligence, as proxied by self-reported GPA, and risk preference. The results do indicate a weak relationship between risk preference and personality constructs. Increasing the sample size, clearer instructions on the risk preference elicitation game, and expanding the relative risk categorization from 3 to 8 categories may yield more robust measures of personality and risk. The correlations, intended to populate an intelligent agent simulation system, are not sufficiently robust to provide valid information to code human behaviors into FUTURE's agent-based system. In an attempt to overcome the deficits in the current experimental design and outcomes, the subject pool will be expanded by an additional 300 observations. The experimental design discussed in this report will be modified not only to capture a broader subject pool demographic, but will use an eight-category relative risk preference elicitation measure.",

Abstract Recent studies have found correlations between risk attitudes and several sociodemographic characteristics. In this paper, we deploy an artefactual field experiment and study whether subjects -non-professionals and financial professionals -are aware of these correlations. This is largely confirmed by our results for all subject groups. We show that the subjects attach informational value to sociodemographic information when assessing others' risk attitudes. This provides external validity to the correlations found between risk preferences and sociodemographics. A person's self-assessment of risk attitudes is the most helpful device for the subjects' assessments of others, although experienced professionals make use of it to a minor extent than all other subjects.",

However, this invariance property applies with respect to transformations of u and not with respect to arbitrary rescalings of the outcome variables, x. The effects of this misunderstanding has led to ambiguity in classifying attitudes by risk aversion coefficients. It is shown that inappropriate rescalings of the outcome variable can lead to inaccurate rankings produced by generalized stochastic dominance. The Pratt-Arrow absolute risk aversion coefficient (Pratt), defined as r(x) -u\"(x)/u'(x), has been used in many analyses which order alternative action choices under conditions of uncertainty (Cochran, Robison, and Lodwick; Cochran et al.; Danok, McCarl, and White; Holt and Brandt; King and Lybecker; King and Oamek; Kramer and Pope; Lemieux, Richardson, and Nixon; Meyer 1977b; Rister, Skees, and Black; Tauer 1985; Wilson and Eidman 1985; Zacharias and Grube). Problems arise, particularly in applications of generalized stochastic dominance (or stochastic dominance with respect to a function-SDWRF) (Meyer 1977a) when Pratt-Arrow coefficients elicited in one study are used as secondary data in other studies with different outcome ranges. It is well known that the Pratt-Arrow measure is invariant to linear transformations (King and Robison, p. 512). However, this invariance property applies only to transformations of u",

As a direct consequence, we are able to extend the results in Ziegel [42] and Bellini and Bignozzi [7] on convex elicitable risk measures and confirm that expectiles are the only elicitable coherent risk measures. Further, we provide a simple characterisation of robustness for convex risk measures in terms of a weak notion of mixture continuity.",

We first review several applications of a decision perspective to the study of risk-taking behaviors, including studies that investigate consequence generation and the components of the overall utility (i.e., consequence, desirability, and likelihood) of risk-taking and studies that investigate the validity of two decision-oriented models (subjective expected utility and the theory of reasoned action) in predicting risktaking behaviors. We then discuss challenges in modeling risk-taking behaviors from a decision-making perspective. These challenges include (i) finding the factors that are necessary to improve the predictability of models, (ii) difficulties in eliciting the individual components of overall utility, and (iii) incorporating overall utility changes over time.",

However, there is a simple randomized reward function that causes the agent to report the true expected value. The same construction can be used to elicit the mean or the median of the underlying distribution. When rewarding conditional on two independent realizations of the random variable we are able to elicit the variance of one and the covariance of two unknown random variables.",

To investigate whether professionals make such decisions optimally, we conduct an online experiment and survey measuring risk attitudes of security professionals. Participants were asked to state their willingness-to-pay to avoid a series of losses-only lotteries and to make choices between such lotteries. We examine their behaviour in these lotteries and conclude that security professionals do not minimize expected losses. Our findings suggest that security professionals are risk and ambiguity averse and are susceptible to framing effects. We contrast their behaviour to that of a random sample of students. We find that the preferences of security professionals are measurably different from those students in several respects. Finally, we devise a mechanism to elicit professionals\u2019 preferences between security and operability. We find that the nature of professionals\u2019 employment influences their security versus operability preferences. These factors are usually overlooked in risk assessment methodologies.",

These metaphors have been used as excuses to wait for an accident to happen before taking risk management measures, both in industry and government. These two images represent two distinct types of uncertainties (epistemic and aleatory). Existing statistics are often insufficient to support risk management because the sample may be too small and the system may have changed. Rationality as defined by the von Neumann axioms leads to a combination of both types of uncertainties into a single probability measure\u2014Bayesian probability\u2014and accounts only for risk aversion. Yet, the decisionmaker may also want to be ambiguity averse. This article presents an engineering risk analysis perspective on the problem, using all available information in support of proactive risk management decisions and considering both types of uncertainty. These measures involve monitoring of signals, precursors, and near\u2010misses, as well as reinforcement of the system and a thoughtful response strategy. It also involves careful examination of organizational factors such as the incentive system, which shape human performance and affect the risk of errors. In all cases, including rare events, risk quantification does not allow \u201cprediction\u201d of accidents and catastrophes. Instead, it is meant to support effective risk management rather than simply reacting to the latest events and headlines.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing deregulation and convergence of energy markets have made it imperative for energy utilities to adopt systematic risk management policies. Effective implementation of these policies calls for adequate risk information, which is typically synthesized by combining inputs from several risk analysis methods. Many utilities select such methods informally, based on subjective perceptions of how well these methods contribute to the objectives of their risk management strategy. In this paper, we address this selection problem through decision analysis; specifically, we (i) develop a systematic multi-criteria framework for evaluating collections of risk analysis methods and (ii) report a case study where such collections were evaluated with a novel decision support tool which accommodates incomplete preference information. Drawing upon this case study, we argue that the development of a systematic framework can contribute to an improved understanding of key issues in risk management and engender potential savings due to better decision-making. From the viewpoint of energy utility, the implementation of effective risk management practices calls for deliberate choices at several levels of decision making. At the highest level, risk policy is characterized by established rules and guidelines that are relatively permanent and reflect the utility's overall business goals and its stance vis-\u00e0-vis risks (e.g., the company shall not engage in excessive speculation). Within the utility's business strategy, risk strategy translates this policy into more concrete risk management actions, for instance by outlining choices among alternative risk analysis methods. Overall, while the design of a risk management system is based on the utility's risk policy, it also calls for a continual (re-)evaluation of its risk management strategy, which in turn usually necessitates an iterative planning cycle. A typical energy utility company may act in three roles, i.e., as a hedger, speculator or arbitrageur. Although these roles share the same risk policy, each one interprets this policy from its own risk management perspective which places specific requirements on the choice of risk analysis methods. Furthermore, the utility's different operational",

Although previous research suggests that the affect heuristic reliably predicts an inverse correlation between risk and benefit judgments, it has not yet been tested if the affect heuristic is sensitive to elicitation method effects (joint/separate evaluation) and to what extent individual differences in cognitive abilities may mediate the risk-benefit correlation. Across two studies we find that (1) the risk-benefit correlation is stable across different elicitation methods and for different domains (e.g., social domain, sensation-seeking domain, health domain, economic domain) and (2) the strength of the inverse correlation is tied to individual cognitive abilities-primarily cognitive reflection ability.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides a systematic analysis of individual attitudes towards ambiguity, based on laboratory experiments. The design of the analysis captures different degrees of ambiguity in various settings, and it allows to disentangle attitudes towards risk and attitudes towards ambiguity. In addition to individual attitudes, the experiments also elicit expectations about other participants\u2019 attitudes, allowing us to relate own behavior to expectations about others. New measures are introduced for both, the degree of ambiguity in a situation and ambiguity aversion. Ambiguity is embedded in standard utility theory and a parameter of ambiguity aversion is estimated and contrasted to the parameter of risk aversion. The analysis provides a test of theoretical models of ambiguity aversion. The main findings are that ambiguity aversion on average is much more pronounced than human aversion against risk and that it is very different across individuals. Moreover, while most theoretical work on ambiguity builds on maxmin expected utility, our results provide evidence that MEU does not adequately capture individual attitudes towards ambiguity.

        "abstract": "Our society is fascinated with risk in many different areas and disciplines. One of the main ways to describe and communicate the level of risk is through risk indices, which summarize risk using numbers or categories such as words, letters, or colors. These indices are used to communicate risks to the public, understand how risk is changing over time, compare among different risks, and support decision making. Given the different methods to construct risk indices, including flawed methods such as risk matrices, this article develops specific steps that analysts can follow to create a risk index. This article emphasizes the importance of describing risk with a probability distribution, developing a numerical risk measure that summarizes the probability distribution, and finally translating the risk measure to an index. Measuring the risk is the most difficult part and requires the analyst to summarize a probability distribution into one or possibly a few numbers. The risk measure can then be transformed to a numerical or categorical index. I apply the method outlined in this article to construct a risk index that compares the risk of fatalities in aviation and highway transportation.",

Embraced by the Basel accords, value-at-risk and expected shortfall are the leading measures of financial risk. Expectiles offset the weaknesses of value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall. Indeed, expectiles are the only elicitable law-invariant coherent risk measures. After reviewing practical concerns involving backtesting and robustness, this article more closely examines regulatory applications of expectiles. Expectiles are most readily evaluated as a special class of quantiles. For ease of regulatory implementation, expectiles can be defined exclusively in terms of VaR, expected shortfall, and the thresholds at which those competing risk measures are enforced. Moreover, expectiles are in harmony with gain/loss ratios in financial risk management. Expectiles may address some of the flaws in VaR and expected shortfall-subject to the reservation that no risk measure can achieve exactitude in regulation.",

We find that a measure, combining experiments rooted in expected utility theory and measures derived from surveys, explains spot and contractual sales, but does not exhibit substantially greater explanatory power than its underlying components. Survey-based measures are generally more significant indicators of marketing choices, but experimental measures reveal how risk attitudes vary over a range of probable outcomes, which is important in light of increased commodity price volatility. Given recently identified limitations on the applicability of expected utility theory, we suggest that researchers include survey methods to obtain low-cost supplemental measures.

The experiments were carried out across Denmark using a representative sample of 253 people between 19 and 75 years of age. Risk attitudes are estimated for various individuals differentiated by socio-demographic characteristics such as income and age. Our results indicate that the average Dane is risk averse, and that risk neutrality is an inappropriate assumption to apply. We also find that risk attitudes vary significantly with respect to several important sociodemographic variables. Our results consistently support the need to recognize the heterogeneity of risk attitudes across individual subjects, as well as the need to use flexible utility functions that do not impose strong restrictions on estimates of risk attitudes on an a priori basis. These findings have important implications for the characterization of risk attitudes in policy applications, theoretical modeling, and experimental economics.",

The standard Holt and Laury\u2019s procedure (2002) is implemented in the loss domain, while the second tool is based on contextualized experimental hedging choices for insurance and loss reduction (secondary prevention). Our findings highlight the high consistency between the two procedures for more than two-thirds of the subjects, both measures leading to the same risk-attitude assignment. Interestingly, cases where the two measures do not coincide concern the only subjects whose Holt and Laury\u2019s risk aversion coefficient is borderline. For these participants, using both measures allows for a more accurate assessment. Finally, the HL-irrational behavior of participants uncovers specific risk-averse behavior signature, while contextualized-irrational behavior reveals a risk-loving behavior.",

Our evidence is broadly consistent with the hypothesis that individual preferences figure importantly in major investment decisions.

        "abstract": "Despite many claims for and against the use of risk comparisons in risk communication, few empirical studies have explored their effect. Even fewer have examined the public's relative preferences among different kinds of risk comparisons. Two studies, published in this journal in 1990 and 2003, used seven measures of \u201cacceptability\u201d to examine public reaction to 14 examples of risk comparisons, as used by a hypothetical factory manager to explain risks of his ethylene oxide plant. This study examined the effect on preferences of scenarios involving low or high conflict between the factory manager and residents of the hypothetical town (as had the 2003 study), and inclusion of a claim that the comparison demonstrated the risks' acceptability. It also tested the Finucane et al. (2000) affect hypothesis that information emphasizing low risks\u2014as in these risk comparisons\u2014would raise benefits estimates without changing risk estimates. Using similar but revised scenarios, risk comparison examples (10 instead of 14), and evaluation measures, an opportunity sample of 303 New Jersey residents rated the comparisons, and the risks and benefits of the factory. On average, all comparisons received positive ratings on all evaluation measures in all conditions. Direct and indirect measures showed that the conflict manipulation worked; overall, No\u2010Conflict and Conflict scenarios evoked scores that were not significantly different. The attachment to each risk comparison of a risk acceptability claim (\u201cSo our factory's risks should be acceptable to you.\u201d) did not worsen ratings relative to conditions lacking this claim. Readers who did or did not see this claim were equally likely to infer an attempt to persuade them to accept the risk from the comparison. As in the 2003 article, there was great individual variability in inferred rankings of the risk comparisons. However, exposure to the risk comparisons did not reduce risk estimates significantly (while raising benefit estimates), and Conflict\u2010Claim respondents found the risk of the hypothetical factory less acceptable than No\u2010Conflict respondents. Results suggest that neither risk comparisons nor risk acceptability claims are automatically anathema to audiences, but they may have tiny or unintended effects on audience judgments about risky situations.",

Le deuxi\u00e8me article est une analyse probabiliste du comportement de cette derni\u00e8re approche d'allocation en fonction de la nature des distributions marginales des risques et de la structure de la d\u00e9pendance. Le comportement asymptotique de l'allocation est aussi \u00e9tudi\u00e9 et l'impact de la d\u00e9pendance est illustr\u00e9 par diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les marginaux et diff\u00e9rentes copules.

It is based on taking into account the own risk profile and the internal view of risk through the ability to use internal models for calculating solvency capital requirement and ORSA (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment) approach for internal risk management. It makes the mathematical modeling an essential tool for a successful regulatory exercise. The risk theory must allow to support this development by providing answers to practical problems, especially those related to the dependence modeling and the choice of risk measures. In the same context, this thesis presents a contribution to improving the management of insurance risks. In four chapters we present multivariate risk measures and their application to the allocation of solvency capital. The first part of this thesis is devoted to the introduction and study of a new family of multivariate elicitable risk measures that we will call multivariate expectiles. The first chapter presents these measures and explains the different construction approaches. The multivariate expectiles verify a set of coherence properties that we also discuss in this chapter before proposing a stochastic approximation tool of these risk measures. The performance of this method is insufficient in the asymptotic levels of the expectiles thresholds. That makes the theoretical analysis of the asymptotic behavior necessary. The asymptotic behavior of multivariate expectiles is then the subject of the second chapter of this part. It is studied in a multivariate regular variations framework, and some results are given in the case of equivalent marginal tails. We also study in the second chapter of the first part the asymptotic behavior of multivariate expectiles under previous assumptions in the presence of a perfect dependence, or in the case of asymptotic independence. Finally, we propose using extreme values statistics some estimators of the asymptotic expectile in these cases. The second part of the thesis is focused on the issue of solvency capital allocation in insurance. It is divided into two chapters; each chapter consists of a published paper. The first one presents an axiomatic characterization of the coherence of a capital allocation method in a general framework. Then it studies the coherence properties of an allocation approach based on the minimization of some multivariate risk indicators. The second paper is a probabilistic analysis of the behavior of this capital allocation method based on the nature of the marginal distributions of risks and the dependence structure. The asymptotic behavior of the optimal allocation is also studied and the impact of dependence is illustrated using some selected models and copulas. Faced to the significant presence of dependence between the various risks taken by insurance companies, a multivariate approach seems more appropriate to build responses to the various issues of risk management. This thesis is based on a multidimensional vision of risk and proposes some multivariate risk measures that can be applied to several actuarial issues of a multivariate natur",

The relationship between the risk aversion coefficients of natural resource managers, their characteristics, and the different studies has still not been elucidated. Using 63 studies, we shed light on why the partial, absolute and relative estimated risk aversion coefficients of natural resource managers differ. We investigated, through a meta-regression, the incidence of choices made by authors (elicitation method, measure of risk aversion coefficient, payoff choice) and characteristics of the natural resource managers (geographical location, type of activities) on the estimated risk aversion coefficients. Our results show that the model for the relative risk aversion coefficient has a stronger explanatory power than those for partial and absolute coefficients. The three coefficients are mainly explained by the type of publication, the elicitation procedure and the type of activities. However, the level of economic development of the country and the type of payoff (i.e., hypothetical or real) seem to have no impact whatsoever on the estimated coefficient. We also provide ranges for each type of risk aversion coefficient \u2013 absolute, partial and relative.",

        "abstract": "This thesis consists of three closely related studies investigating individual decision-making under risk and uncertainty, with a focus on decision weighting. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the common themes and theoretical framework for this research. \n \nChapter 2 reports the development of a simple method to measure the probability weighting function of Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) and rank-dependent utility theories. Our method, called the Neo-Lite method, is based on Abdellaoui et al. (2011)\u2019s source method and the Neo-additive weighting function (Chateauneuf et al., 2007). It can be used for both risk (known probabilities) and for ambiguity (unknown probabilities). The novelty of our method lies in how data of decision weights are used to obtain the measurement of the whole function. Compared to the more widely used parametric fitting, our method is simpler, as it minimizes the number of decision weights required and does not rely on the elicitation of subjective probabilities (for ambiguity). An experiment of choice under risk demonstrates the simplicity and tractability of our method. The predictive performance of probability weighting functions measured using our method is shown to be almost equally good to that measured using the standard parametric fitting method. \n \nChapter 3 presents a theory of choice under risk primarily to explain why individual probability weighting functions are often found to be non-linear and inverse-S shaped. Our rationale for non-linear probability weighting is based on a psychologically grounded feature of choice making, a feature we call attention-based state weighting. We show that, under well-defined circumstances, our theory can be equivalent to Cumulative Prospect Theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) with a probability weighting function depending on not only ranks but also sizes of outcomes of risky prospects. This allows our theory to accommodate evidence about probability weighting that cannot be explained by Prospect Theory or Cumulative Prospect Theory. \nThe evidence just mentioned refers to recent findings that people have stake-sensitive probability weighting functions. Chapter 4 reports an experiment that further explores the idea of stake-sensitive decision weighting. In addition, the experiment also tests hypotheses derived from the theory presented Chapter 3. In this chapter, we use a more general concept, decision weights, to refer to probability weights that can be stake-sensitive. Particularly we investigate whether and how decision weights are affected by two main properties of a lottery: outcome level (or expected payoff level) and outcome spacing (or the ratio of the best outcome of the lottery to its worst outcome). We elicit subjects\u2019 Certainty-Equivalents for carefully-designed sets of lotteries and estimate their decision weights and utility curvatures using a model slightly more general than Cumulative Prospect Theory. Our main finding is that only outcome spacing has significant and systematic influence on decision weighting at the aggregate level, and that both outcome level and outcome spacing have systematic and significant effects at individual levels. This finding, together with the theory of Chapter 3, challenges the common understanding of probability weighting. \n \n \nChapter 5 concludes the thesis by summarizing all findings in previous chapters, discussing the implications, and pointing to directions for future research.",

To what extent is there a general factor of risk preference, R, akin to g, the general factor of intelligence? Can risk preference be regarded as a stable psychological trait? These conceptual issues persist because few attempts have been made to integrate multiple risk-taking measures, particularly measures from different and largely unrelated measurement traditions (self-reported propensity measures assessing stated preferences, incentivized behavioral measures eliciting revealed preferences, and frequency measures assessing actual risky activities). Adopting a comprehensive psychometric approach (1507 healthy adults completing 39 risk-taking measures, with a subsample of 109 participants completing a retest session after 6 months), we provide a substantive empirical foundation to address these issues, finding that correlations between propensity and behavioral measures were weak. Yet, a general factor of risk preference, R, emerged from stated preferences and generalized to specific and actual real-world risky activities (for example, smoking). Moreover, R proved to be highly reliable across time, indicative of a stable psychological trait. Our findings offer a first step toward a general mapping of the construct risk preference, which encompasses both general and domain-specific components, and have implications for the assessment of risk preference in the laboratory and in the wild.",

In this article, we explore the lability of human risk preferences and argue that the most recent choices guide decision-making. Accordingly, our novel proposal and experimental method provide a psychological tool that measures people's shift in preferences. Specifically, in our experiment (240 participants, registered UK users of an online survey panel), we developed and employed a two-stage risk elicitation experimental method. The results from the experiment revealed that providing participants with false feedback on their initial decisions (stage 1) changes their risk preferences at the feedback stage of the experiment in the direction of the false feedback. Moreover, participants' final decisions (stage 2) were influenced by the type of feedback (correct or false) and informed by their altered risk preferences at the feedback stage of the experiment. In conclusion, our work provides experimental evidence that human preferences are constructed \"on the fly,\" influenced by the decision-making context and recent decision-making experience (e.g., Kusev et al., 2020; Slovic, 1995) .",

We conducted a methodology review of reports where probability distributions had been elicited from experts to be used in model-based health technology assessments. METHODS: Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the CRD database were searched from inception to April 2013. Reference lists were checked and citation mapping was also used. Studies describing their approach to the elicitation of probability distributions were included. Data was abstracted on pre-defined aspects of the elicitation technique. Reports were critically appraised on their consideration of the validity, reliability and feasibility of the elicitation exercise. RESULTS: Fourteen articles were included. Across these studies, the most marked features were heterogeneity in elicitation approach and failure to report key aspects of the elicitation method. The most frequently used approaches to elicitation were the histogram technique and the bisection method. Only three papers explicitly considered the validity, reliability and feasibility of the elicitation exercises. CONCLUSION: Judged by the studies identified in the review, reports of expert elicitation are insufficient in detail and this impacts on the perceived usability of expert-elicited probability distributions. In this context, the wider credibility of elicitation will only be improved by better reporting and greater standardisation of approach. Until then, the advantage of eliciting probability distributions from experts may be lost. elicitation, expert opinion, subjective probabilities, health technology assessment, decision-analytic models, uncertainty \uf0b7 The elicitation of probability distributions from experts to enhance the modelling process is an integral part of health technology assessment \uf0b7 The majority of reports presenting expert elicitation of probability distribution were incomplete, making critical appraisal of these exercises difficult. \uf0b7 By disseminating reports of such exercises conducted in health technology assessment, research is encouraged towards building a framework for conducting and evaluating the elicitation of probability distributions. Background Model-based economic evaluations carried out as part of Health Technology Assessments (HTA) rely on the synthesis of various types of scientific evidence and economic data to inform policy decisions on the optimal use of health care resources. When research data needed for cost-effectiveness decision analytic models are lacking, the opinion of clinical experts is a widely accepted source of evidence, routinely used despite expert opinion being regarded as the least reliable form of scientific evidence [1]. The process of formally capturing expert opinion for use in decision-analytic models in healthcare has been addressed in a number of papers [2, 3], but very little of the literature is concerned with the elicitation of probability distributions from experts on unknown quantities.

        "abstract": "Expert judgment elicitation is often required in probabilistic decision making and the evaluation of risk. One measure of the quality of probability distributions given by experts is calibration--the faithfulness of the probabilities in an empirically verifiable sense. A method of measuring calibration for continuous probability distributions is presented here. A discussion of the impact of using linear rules for combining such judgments is given and an empirical demonstration is given using data collected from experts participating in a large-scale risk study. It is shown by theoretical argument that combining well-calibrated distributions of individual experts using linear rules can only result in reducing calibration. In contrast, it is demonstrated, both by example and empirically, that an equally weighted linear combination of experts who tend to be \"overconfident\" can produce distributions that are better calibrated than the experts' individual distributions. Using data from training exercises, it is shown that the improvement in calibration is rapid as the number of experts is increased from one to five or six, but there is only modest improvement from increasing the number of experts beyond that point.",

In an experiment, subjects invest in a portfolio that contains a risk-free bond and a risky asset which has high or low return states with equal probability. The experiment elicits aspirations of subjects and predicts asset allocation in the bond and risky asset so that it meets their aspirations. A measure of risk is developed using the aspiration data since a more risk-averse subject shall conservatively set her aspiration in A1. Intuitively, satisficing by aspiration setting tones down the extreme possibilities and thus presents less risky prospects to subjects. The study also calibrates the degree of satisficing by mapping the satisficing approach to the expected utility approach. The degree of satisficing exhibits how the decision maker limits her possible loss by forgoing possible gains. The findings of the study are reflective that in certain situations, the utility from a satisficing decision is greater than maximising, therefore making it a valuable approach for market design.",

Many psychologists aim to uncover the extent to which stable personality characteristics-psychological traits-account for why individuals differ in their appetite for risk and in their decision to engage in such behaviors. The endeavors of psychologists not only reflect an effort to understand human behavior per se, but also aim to better diagnose and prevent undesirable levels of risk taking, with the ultimate goal of improving the physical or mental health and the financial well-being of individuals and populations. In what follows, we use the term \"risk preference\" to refer to such a psychological trait (or collection of traits) and explore the extent to which both psychologists and economists can use it to explain individual differences in people's appetite for risk. Debates surrounding the nature of risk preference and its measurement have a long history in psychology and economics, and the number of discussion points",

        "abstract": "Our concept of nine risk evaluation criteria, six risk classes, a decision tree, and three management categories was developed to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and political feasibility of risk management procedures. The main task of risk evaluation and management is to develop adequate tools for dealing with the problems of complexity, uncertainty. and ambiguity. Based on the characteristics of different risk types and these three major problems, we distinguished three types of management--risk-based, precaution-based, and discourse-based strategies. The risk-based strategy--is the common solution to risk problems. Once the probabilities and their corresponding damage potentials are calculated, risk managers are required to set priorities according to the severity of the risk, which may be operationalized as a linear combination of damage and probability or as a weighted combination thereof. Within our new risk classification, the two central components have been augmented with other physical and social criteria that still demand risk-based strategies as long as uncertainty is low and ambiguity absent. Risk-based strategies are best solutions to problems of complexity and some components of uncertainty, for example, variation among individuals. If the two most important risk criteria, probability of occurrence and extent of damage, are relatively well known and little uncertainty is left, the traditional risk-based approach seems reasonable. If uncertainty plays a large role, in particular, indeterminacy or lack of knowledge, the risk-based approach becomes counterproductive. Judging the relative severity of risks on the basis of uncertain parameters does not make much sense. Under these circumstances, management strategies belonging to the precautionary management style are required. The precautionary approach has been the basis for much of the European environmental and health protection legislation and regulation. Our own approach to risk management has been guided by the proposition that any conceptualization of the precautionary principle should be (1) in line with established methods of scientific risk assessments, (2) consistent and discriminatory (avoiding arbitrary results) when it comes to prioritization, and (3) at the same time, specific with respect to precautionary measures, such as ALARA or BACT, or the strategy of containing risks in time and space. This suggestion does, however, entail a major problem: looking only to the uncertainties does not provide risk managers with a clue about where to set priorities for risk reduction. Risks vary in their degree of remaining uncertainties. How can one judge the severity of a situation when the potential damage and its probability are unknown or contested? In this dilemma, we advise risk managers to use additional criteria of hazardousness, such as \"ubiquity versibility,\" and \"pervasiveness over time,\" as proxies for judging severity. Our approach also distinguishes clearly between uncertainty and ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to a situation of being unclear about factual statements; ambiguity to a situation of contested views about the desirability or severity of a given hazard. Uncertainty can be resolved in principle by more cognitive advances (with the exception of indeterminacy). ambiguity only by discourse. Discursive procedures include legal deliberations as well as novel participatory approaches. In addition, discursive methods of planning and conflict resolution can be used. If ambiguities are associated with a risk problem, it is not enough to demonstrate that risk regulators are open to public concerns and address the issues that many people wish them to take care ot The process of risk evaluation itself needs to be open to public input and new forms of deliberation. We have recommended a tested set of deliberative processes that are, at least in principle, capable of resolving ambiguities in risk debates (for a review, see Renn, Webler, & Wiedemaun. 1995). Deliberative processes are needed, however, for ail three types of management. Risk-based management relies on epistemiological, uncertainty-based management on reflective, and discourse-based management on participatory discourse forms. These three types of discourse could be labeled as an analytic-deliberative procedure for risk evaluation and management. We see the advantage of a deliberative style of regulation and management in a dynamic balance between procedure and outcome. Procedure should not have priority over the outcome; outcome should not have priority over the procedure. An intelligent combination of both can elaborate the required prerequisites of democratic deliberation and its substantial outcomes to enhance the legitimacy of political decisions (Guttman & Thompson, 1996; Bohman, 1997. 1998).",

In this work, we give a unified proof of single\u2010loop consistency that applies to any measure satisfying a common rationale. This proof is not only more general but invokes less restrictive assumptions than heretofore in the literature, allowing for the presence of correlations among model inputs and of categorical variables. We examine numerical convergence of such an estimator under a variety of sensitivity measures. We also examine its application to a published medical case study.",

        "abstract": "Environmental health impact assessments often have to deal with substantial uncertainties. Typically, the knowledge-base is limited with incomplete, or inconsistent evidence and missing or ambiguous data. Consulting experts can help to identify and address uncertainties. Methods: Formal expert elicitation is a structured approach to systematically consult experts on uncertain issues. It is most often used to quantify ranges for poorly known parameters, but may also be useful to further develop qualitative issues such as definitions, assumptions or conceptual (causal) models. A thorough preparation and systematic design and execution of an expert elicitation process may increase the validity of its outcomes and transparency and trustworthiness of its conclusions. Various expert elicitation protocols and methods exist. However, these are often not universally applicable, and need customization to suite the needs of a specific study. In this paper, we set out to develop a widely applicable method for the use of expert elicitation in environmental health impact assessment. Results: We present a practical yet flexible seven step procedure towards organising expert elicitation in the context of environmental health impact assessment, based on existing protocols. We describe how customization for specific applications is always necessary. In particular, three issues affect the choice of methods for a particular application: the types of uncertainties considered, the intended use of the elicited information, and the available resources. We outline how these three considerations guide choices regarding the design and execution of expert elicitation. We present signposts to sources where the issues are discussed in more depth to give the newcomer the insights needed to make the protocol work. The seven step procedure is illustrated using examples from earlier published elicitations in the field of environmental health research. Conclusions: We conclude that, despite some known criticism on its validity, formal expert elicitation can support environmental health research in various ways. Its main purpose is to provide a temporary summary of the limited available knowledge, which can serve as a provisional basis for policy until further research has been carried out.",

Hence, a decision maker's processing of probabilities and the resulting degree of probability weighting should not vary within the domain of risk. This paper provides evidence that challenges this assumption. We conduct two experiments involving different gambles, that is, risky games where objective probabilities are known, no further information-based advantages exist, and outcomes are independent of knowledge. Even though all probabilities are explicitly provided, we find that individuals exhibit more pronounced inverse-S-shaped probability weighting if they perceive their level of expertise regarding a gamble to be lower. This result suggests that individuals are subject to ignorance illusion in decisions under risk, constituting expertisedependent risk attitudes. We document that ignorance illusion stems from the wrongly assigned importance of perceived expertise in the decision-making process and that it occurs in both the gain and the loss domain.",

We find that the different risk-attitude measures are related, and that the global risk-attitude construct is significantly related to farmers' intention to use futures contracts.

Emotion regulation techniques can improve the quality of decisions, but there are several challenges to evaluating these techniques in a controlled research context. Determining the effectiveness of emotion regulation techniques requires methodology that can: 1) reliably elicit desired emotions in decision-makers; 2) include decision tasks with response measures that are sensitive to emotional loading; and 3) support repeated exposures/trials with relatively-consistent emotional loading and response sensitivity. The current study investigates one common method, the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART), for its consistency and reliability in measuring the risk-propensity of decision-makers, and specifically how the method\u2019s effectiveness might change over the course of repeated exposures. With the PANASX subjective assessment serving for comparison, results suggest the BART assessment method, when applied over repeated exposures, is reduced in its sensitivity to emotional stimuli and exhibits decision task-related learning effects which influence the observed trends in response data in complex ways. This work is valuable for researchers in decision-making and to guide design for humans with consideration for their affective states.",

In this paper, we use an alternative method, Best-Worst Scaling (BWS), to elicit relative risk perceptions concerning potentially unsafe domestic food behaviours. We analyse heterogeneity in those risk perceptions via estimation of latent class models. We identify 6 latent segments of differing risk perception profiles with the probability of membership of those segments differing between experts and the lay public. The BWS method provides a practical approach to assessing relative risks as the choices made by the participants and subsequent analysis have a strong theoretical basis. It does so without the influence of scale bias, the cognitive burden of ranking a large number of items or issues of aggregation of data, often associated with the more commonly used psychometric paradigm. We contend that BWS, in conjunction with latent class modelling, provides a powerful method for eliciting risk rankings and identifying differences in these rankings in the population.",

        "abstract": "Many applications in decision making under uncertainty and probabilistic risk assessment require the assessment of multiple, dependent uncertain quantities, so that in addition to marginal distributions, interdependence needs to be modelled in order to properly understand the overall risk. Nevertheless, relevant historical data on dependence information are often not available or simply too costly to obtain. In this case, the only sensible option is to elicit this uncertainty through the use of expert judgements. In expert judgement studies, a structured approach to eliciting variables of interest is desirable so that their assessment is methodologically robust. One of the key decisions during the elicitation process is the form in which the uncertainties are elicited. This choice is subject to various, potentially conflicting, desiderata related to e.g. modelling convenience, coherence between elicitation parameters and the model, combining judgements, and the assessment burden for the experts. While extensive and systematic guidance to address these considerations exists for single variable uncertainty elicitation, for higher dimensions very little such guidance is available. Therefore this paper offers a systematic review of the current literature on eliciting dependence. The literature on the elicitation of dependence parameters such as correlations is presented alongside commonly used dependence models and experience from case studies. From this, guidance about the strategy for dependence assessment is given and gaps in the existing research are identified to determine future directions for structured methods to elicit dependence. (Anca M. Hanea), O.MoralesNapoles@tudelft.nl (Oswaldo Morales-N\u00e1poles) cause variables in the model are correlated, or indirectly when an uncertainty analysis of model parameters is carried out to explore model robustness. Both cases exhibit complex interrelations and dependencies which need to be considered if assumptions such as independence are not 10 justifiable. However, it is often not straightforward to either model or quantify dependence. In particular whenever no relevant historical data are available, the only sensible way to achieve uncertainty quantification is through eliciting ex-15",

Abstract Quality requirements, i.e. those requirements that pertain to a system's quality attributes, are traditionally regarded to be useful only when they are represented quantitatively so that they can be measured. This article presents a value-oriented approach to specifying quality requirements that deviates from the classic approach. This approach uses a broad range of potential representations that are selected on the basis of risk assessment. Requirements engineers select a quality requirement representation such that they get an optimal balance between mitigating the risk of developing a system that doesn't satisfy the stakeholders' desires and needs on the one hand and the cost of specifying the requirement in the selected representation on the other hand. This issue is part of a special issue on quality requirements.",

        "abstract": "The notion of risk measure is indispensable for financial risk management. Although the value-at-risk (VaR) is still used in practice, it is not coherent in the sense of Artzner et al. [2], so it is natural to seek for other risk measures fulfilling some desirable theoretical properties. According to Kusuoka [6], the class of distortion risk measures is the one we should use if we stick to the law invariance and comonotonic additivity in addition to the four axioms of coherence, and is broad enough to fully express agents\u2019 subjective assessment of risk. If one is to apply this risk measure to practical financial risk management problems, it is necessary to pick one distortion function suitable for his/her purpose. One\u2019s choice from among these distortion risk measures should be based on his/her attitude towards risk, but we need some quantitative guidelines helping our understanding of the characteristics of those risk measures. There are many known parametric families of distortion functions to construct distortion risk measures (including the renowned expected shortfall (ES), and the author\u2019s proposals in Tsukahara [12]). One of the main purpose of the present paper is to give a comprehensive comparative study of several families of distortion risk measures in several aspects. VaR is also included as a target for comparison in view of its practical popularity. For the class of distortion risk measures, a natural estimator has the form of L-statistics. In Tsukahara [14], we have investigated the large sample properties of general L-statistics based on weakly dependent data and apply them to our estimator. Under certain regularity conditions, which are somewhat weaker than the ones found in the literature, we prove that the estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. Furthermore we give a consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance using spectral density estimators of a related stationary sequence. The behavior of the estimator is examined using simulation in a simple inverse-gamma autoregressive stochastic volatility model. It is found both theoretically and by simulation study that the estimator always suffers a negative bias. We will discuss bias correction methods in the i.i.d. case and the possibility of their extension to the dependent case using bootstrap methods with dependent data. Also, we will indicate how the asymptotic results for our estimator can be extended to the estimator for law invariant risk measures, which are obtained by dropping comonotonic additivity requirement. Another issue we would like to address in this paper is backtesting. The purpose They are called spectral risk measures in Acerbi [1], and weighted V@R in Cherny [3]. of backtesting is usually twofold: to monitor the performance of the model and estimation methods for risk measurement, and to compare relative performance of the models and methods (see e.g., McNeil et al. [8]). We focus on the former in this paper. Statistically, it is just a form of cross validation; the ex ante risk measure forecast from the model is compared with the ex post realized portfolio loss. In the case of VaR, a popular procedure for backtesting VaR depends on the number of VaR violations ; we say that a VaR violation occurred when the loss exceeds VaR. Extending a backtesting procedure for the renowned expected shortfall (ES) suggested in McNeil and Frey [7], we construct, based on a simple observation, a backtesting procedure for distortion risk measures, and check its effectiveness in a simulation study using ES and also proportional odds distortion risk measure. Some related issues such as (non-)elicitability of distortion risk measures and a consistency notion of Davis [5] will be discussed in passing. Capital allocation is an important application of risk measure theory. The problem is how to allocate the overall risk capital to the individual investment opportunities in a fair way, and the Euler capital allocation emerged with certain economical justifications (see Tasche [9] and Denault [4]). The Euler capital allocation based on distortion risk measures are easy to compute and widely applicable (c.f. Tsanakas and Barnett [11], Tsanakas [10]), and we evaluate numerically how the Euler allocations based on different distortion risk measures (including proportional hazards distortion risk measure by Wang [15]) perform under several dependence scenarios using some copulas. We remark that the portfolio optimization problem with distortion risk measures is investigated in Acerbi [1]. We conclude with some discussions on the multiperiod extension of distortion risk measures and its associated problems.",

We conduct a large-scale simulation to assess whether an elicitation procedure based on the trade-off method, which essentially equals that used in recent empirical studies, allows to reliably measure the quantity of interest. We find a strong systematic distortion of measurement, which points at the limitations of the presently available elicitation techniques.",

Only one prior study ( Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1985 ) has previously investigated the veracity of expert versus lay judgments of the magnitude of risk. In that study, a heterogeneous grouping of 15 experts was found to judge, using marginal estimations, a variety of risks as closer to the true annual frequencies of death than convenience samples of the lay population. In this study, we use a larger, homogenous sample of experts performing an ecologically valid task. We also ask our respondents to assess frequencies and relative frequencies directly, rather than ask for a \u201crisk\u201d estimate\u2014a response mode subject to possible qualitative attributions\u2014as was done in the Slovic et al. study. Although we find that the experts outperformed lay persons on a number of measures, the differences are small, and both groups showed similar global biases in terms of: (1) overestimating the likelihood of dying from a condition (marginal probability) and of dying from a condition given that it happens to you (conditional probability), and (2) underestimating the ratios of marginal and conditional likelihoods between pairs of potentially lethal events. In spite of these scaling problems, both groups showed quite good performance in ordering the lethal events in terms of marginal and conditional likelihoods. We discuss the nature of expertise using a framework developed by Bolger and Wright (1994) , and consider whether the commonsense assumption of the superiority of expert risk assessors in making magnitude judgments of risk is, in fact, sensible.",

Abstract: This article reviews two leading measures of financial risk and an emerging alternative. Embraced by the Basel accords, value-at-risk and expected shortfall are the leading measures of financial risk. Expectiles offset the weaknesses of value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall. Indeed, expectiles are the only elicitable law-invariant coherent risk measures. After reviewing practical concerns involving backtesting and robustness, this article more closely examines regulatory applications of expectiles. Expectiles are most readily evaluated as a special class of quantiles. For ease of regulatory implementation, expectiles can be defined exclusively in terms of VaR, expected shortfall, and the thresholds at which those competing risk measures are enforced. Moreover, expectiles are in harmony with gain/loss ratios in financial risk management. Expectiles may address some of the flaws in VaR and expected shortfall-subject to the reservation that no risk measure can achieve exactitude in regulation.",

We argue that this is partially due to a misalignment of the underlying sources of risk. Trusting is giving up control to a human source of risk while lottery risk has a mechanistic source. We propose a risky trust game that experimentally elicits social risk preferences that pertain to the same underlying human source. Our results show that transfers in the classic trust game are indeed best explained by social risk preferences and not by lottery risk preferences with an underlying mechanistic source. In addition, we argue that the type of uncertainty also plays a role. In the absence of objectively known probabilities of trustworthiness, trust also has an ambiguous component. We therefore decompose uncertainty in the trust game into social risk and an ambiguous component. Our results provide evidence that, when accounting for social risk, subjects who score high on ambiguity tolerance explain some of the remainder of trusting behavior.",

Why, then, do health, safety, and environmental (HS&E) and reliability engineering risk analysts insist on defining risk more flexibly, as being determined by probabilities and consequences, rather than simply by variances? This note suggests an answer by providing a simple proof that mean-variance decision making violates the principle that a rational decisionmaker should prefer higher to lower probabilities of receiving a fixed gain, all else being equal. Indeed, simply hypothesizing a continuous increasing indifference curve for mean-variance combinations at the origin is enough to imply that a decisionmaker must find unacceptable some prospects that offer a positive probability of gain and zero probability of loss.

Abstract We elicit risk preferences and their determinants through a survey and field experiments for cattle farmers in Namibia who are subject to heterogeneous environmental risk. Survey data is complemented with precipitation data simulated by a climate model to analyze the relationship between risk preferences and individual precipitation risk. We find that risk aversion is inversely related to precipitation risk. When considering individual opportunity sets we find that background risk is not heterogeneous and that liquidity constraints do not influence risk aversion. The observed pattern in behavior towards risk and the interaction with environmental risk can thus be attributed to preferences. JEL-Classification: D81, Q12, Q57",

Rather than directly modelling risk preferences by a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function of wealth, risk preferences and the expected utility of wealth are derived from consumption and investment decisions over time. Rather than using future wealth as the reference point for evaluation risk preferences, current wealth is used instead. The revived theory is both normative and descriptive. It specifies how rational people ought to make decisions under risk and explains the major empirical findings about how people actually make decisions. For example the Allais Paradox and its variations, preference reversals and framing effects all result from rational decisions by uniformly risk-averse people. Moreover, apparently risk-seeking behaviour can result from risk-averse people with low rates of time preference taking risks to save for the future. The revived theory also shows why eliciting certainty equivalents cannot measure peoples' risk preferences but leads to new procedures for measuring both time and risk preferences. (JEL D81, D91).",

        "abstract": "Abstract It is problematic to treat systemic risk as a merely technical problem that can be solved by natural-science methods and through biological and ecological analogies. There appears to be a discrepancy between understanding systemic risk from a natural-science perspective and the unresolved challenges that arise when humans with their initiatives and interactions are included in systemic-risk considerations. It is therefore necessary to investigate possible fundamental differences and similarities of systemic risk with and without accounting for human involvement. Focusing on applied and implementation aspects of measuring, modeling, and managing systemic risks, we identify three important and distinct features characterizing such fundamental differences: indetermination, indecision, and responsibility. We contend that, first, including human initiatives and interactions in systemic-risk considerations must emphasize a type of variability that is especially relevant in this context, namely the role of free will as a fundamental source of essential indetermination in human agency. Second, we postulate that collective indecision generated by mutual uncertainty often leads to the suspension or alteration of rules, procedures, scripts, and norms. Consequently, the associated systemic risks cannot be incorporated into explanatory models, as the new causal rules cannot be predicted and accounted for. Third, analogies from biology and ecology, especially the idea of \u2018contagion,\u2019 downplay human agency, and therefore human responsibility, promoting the false belief that systemic risk is a merely technical problem. For each of these three features, we provide recommendations for future directions and suggest how measuring, modeling, and managing approaches from the natural-science domain can best be applied in light of human agency.",

This evidence has been first shown by Bohnet and Zeckhauser (J Econ Behav 98:294-310, 2004) using an adaptation of the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism (BDM, Becker et al. Behav Sci 9:226-232, 1964). We compare their implementation of the BDM mechanism with a new version designed to facilitate subjects' comprehension. We find that, although the two versions produce different distributions of values, the size of betrayal aversion, measured as an average treatment difference between social and natural risk settings, is not different across the two versions. We further show that our implementation is preferable to use in practice as it reduces substantially subjects' mistakes and the likelihood of noisy valuations.",

(this issue) is logically incomplete and invites serious misuse and misinterpretation, as their own example and interpretation illustrate. A key issue is the extent to which these problems are inherent in their methodology, and resolvable by a logically complete assessment (such as Monte Carlo or Bayesian risk assessment), as opposed to being general problems in any risk\u2010assessment methodology. I here attempt to apportion the problems between those inherent in the proposed bounding analysis and those that are more general, such as reliance on questionable expert elicitations. I conclude that the specific methodology of Ha\u2010Duong et al. suffers from logical gaps in the definition and construction of inputs, and hence should not be used in the form proposed. Furthermore, the labor required to do a sound bounding analysis is great enough so that one may as well skip that analysis and carry out a more logically complete probabilistic analysis, one that will better inform the consumer of the appropriate level uncertainty. If analysts insist on carrying out a bounding analysis in place of more thorough assessments, extensive analyses of sensitivity to inputs and assumptions will be essential to display uncertainties, arguably more essential than it would be in full probabilistic analyses.",

        "abstract": "Distortion risk measure (DRM) plays a crucial role in management science and finance particularly actuarial science. Various DRMs have been introduced but little is discussed on which DRM at hand should be chosen to address a decision maker's (DM's) risk preference. This paper aims to fill out the gap. Specifically, we consider a situation where the true distortion function is unknown either because it is difficult to identify/elicit and/or because the DM's risk preference is ambiguous. We introduce a preference robust distortion risk measure (PRDRM), which is based on the worst\u2010case distortion function from an ambiguity set of distortion functions to mitigate the impact arising from the ambiguity. The ambiguity set is constructed under well\u2010known general principles such as concavity and inverse S\u2010shapedness of distortion functions (overweighting on events from impossible to possible or possible to certainty and underweighting on those from possible to more possible) as well as new user\u2010specific information such as sensitivity to tail losses, confidence intervals to some lotteries, and preferences to certain lotteries over others. To calculate the proposed PRDRM, we use the convex and/or concave envelope of a set of points to characterize the curvature of the distortion function and derive a tractable reformulation of the PRDRM when the underlying random loss is discretely distributed. Moreover, we show that the worst\u2010case distortion function is a nondecreasing piecewise linear function and can be determined by solving a linear programming problem. Finally, we apply the proposed PRDRM to a risk capital allocation problem and carry out some numerical tests to examine the efficiency of the PRDRM model.",

We show that what links these traits is the way people handle decisions. Intuitive thinkers are less averse to risk and less averse to ambiguity than individuals who base their decisions on effortful reasoning. We confirm this finding in a series of experiments. One interpretation of our results is that the high-speed of intuitive thinking puts intuitive thinkers at a comparative advantage in situations involving high risk and ambiguity, making them less averse to both. Consistent with this view we show evidence from the field and from the lab that intuitive thinkers perform better than deliberative thinkers when making decisions in highly ambiguous and risky environments. We also find that attitudes toward risk and ambiguity are related to different individual characteristics and wealth. While the wealthy are less averse to risk, they dislike ambiguity more, a finding that has implications for financial puzzles. JEL classification: D81; D83.",

We used five methods to measure utilities under risk and found clear violations of expected utility. Of the theories studied, prospect theory was the most consistent with our data. The main improvement of prospect theory over expected utility was in comparisons between a riskless and a risky prospect (riskless-risk methods). We observed no improvement over expected utility in comparisons between two risky prospects (risk-risk methods). An explanation for the latter observation may be that there was less distortion in probability weighting in the interval 0 10 0 20 than has commonly been observed.",

This elicitation process reduces the burden of time-consuming orientation and training in traditional methods of attribute weight elicitation, and explicitly captures the existing uncertainty and disagreement among experts, rather than attempts to achieve consensus by eliminating them. We identify the relationship between the two methods and conduct sensitivity analysis to elucidate how these methods handle expert consensus or disagreement. We also present a real-world application on elicitation of adversarial preferences over various attack scenarios to show the applicability of our proposed methods.",

Elicitability and identifiability are essential for forecast ranking and validation, $M$- and $Z$-estimation, both possibly in a regression framework. To account for the set-valued nature of many interesting functionals such as quantiles, systemic risk measures or prediction intervals we introduce a theoretical framework of elicitability and identifiability of set-valued functionals. It distinguishes between exhaustive forecasts, being set-valued and aiming at correctly specifying the entire functional, and selective forecasts, content with solely specifying a single point in the correct functional. Uncovering the structural relation between the two corresponding notions of elicitability and identifiability, we establish that a set-valued functional can be either selectively elicitable or exhaustively elicitable. Notably, selections of quantiles such as the lower quantile turn out not to be elicitable in general. Applying these structural results to Vorob'ev quantiles of random sets, we establish their selective identifiability and exhaustive elicitability. In particular, we provide a mixture representation of elementary scores, leading the way to Murphy diagrams. Our paper is complemented by a comprehensive literature review elaborating on common practice in forecast evaluation of set-valued functionals.",

Despite decades of risk perception studies, this article is the first on regulatory cost perceptions. A survey of 744 U.S. residents probed: (1) How knowledgeable are laypeople about regulatory costs incurred to reduce risks? (2) Do laypeople see official estimates of cost and benefit (lives saved) as accurate? (3) (How) do preferences for hypothetical regulations change when mean\u2010preserving spreads of uncertainty replace certain cost or benefit? and (4) (How) do preferences change when unequal interindividual distributions of hypothetical regulatory costs replace equal distributions? Respondents overestimated costs of regulatory compliance, while assuming agencies underestimate costs. Most assumed agency estimates of benefits are accurate; a third believed both cost and benefit estimates are accurate. Cost and benefit estimates presented without uncertainty were slightly preferred to those surrounded by \u201cnarrow uncertainty\u201d (a range of costs or lives entirely within a personally\u2010calibrated zone without clear acceptance or rejection of tradeoffs). Certain estimates were more preferred than \u201cwide uncertainty\u201d (a range of agency estimates extending beyond these personal bounds, thus posing a gamble between favored and unacceptable tradeoffs), particularly for costs as opposed to benefits (but even for costs a quarter of respondents preferred wide uncertainty to certainty). Agency\u2010acknowledged uncertainty in general elicited mixed judgments of honesty and trustworthiness. People preferred egalitarian distributions of regulatory costs, despite skewed actual cost distributions, and preferred progressive cost distributions (the rich pay a greater than proportional share) to regressive ones. Efficient and socially responsive regulations require disclosure of much more information about regulatory costs and risks.",

It is written from the perspective of systems engineering with the hope and expectation that the principles introduced here will be supplemented and complemented by principles from the perspectives of other disciplines. Indeed, there is no claim that the following 10 guiding principles constitute a complete set; rather, the intent is to initiate a discussion on this important subject that will incrementally lead us to a more complete set of guiding principles. The 10 principles are as follows: First Principle: Holism is the common denominator that bridges risk analysis and systems engineering. Second Principle: The process of risk modeling, assessment, management, and communication must be systemic and integrated. Third Principle: Models and state variables are central to quantitative risk analysis. Fourth Principle: Multiple models are required to represent the essence of the multiple perspectives of complex systems of systems. Fifth Principle: Meta\u2010modeling and subsystems integration must be derived from the intrinsic states of the system of systems. Sixth Principle: Multiple conflicting and competing objectives are inherent in risk management. Seventh Principle: Risk analysis must account for epistemic and aleatory uncertainties. Eighth Principle: Risk analysis must account for risks of low probability with extreme consequences. Ninth Principle: The time frame is central to quantitative risk analysis. Tenth Principle: Risk analysis must be holistic, adaptive, incremental, and sustainable, and it must be supported with appropriate data collection, metrics with which to measure efficacious progress, and criteria on the basis of which to act. The relevance and efficacy of each guiding principle is demonstrated by applying it to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration complex Next Generation (NextGen) system of systems.",

Such problems\narise in decision making under uncertainty, such as in portfolio optimization\nand robust systems design. We propose a family of novel Bayesian optimization\nalgorithms that exploit the structure of the objective function to\nsubstantially improve sampling efficiency. Instead of modeling the objective\nfunction directly as is typical in Bayesian optimization, these algorithms\nmodel $F$ as a Gaussian process, and use the implied posterior on the objective\nfunction to decide which points to evaluate. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach in a variety of numerical experiments.",

A scoring function is strictly consistent for a statistical functional, e.g. the expectation, if its expected score is uniquely minimized by this functional. This thesis examines existence and properties of strictly consistent scoring functions for three kinds of functionals. Firstly, we introduce the class of max-functionals, which contains key characteristics from extreme value theory, for instance the extreme value index. We show that its members do not allow for forecast evaluation via strictly consistent scoring functions in a very strong sense. The second part develops results for interval forecasts. Strictly consistent scoring functions exist and can be characterized for two types, the equal-tailed and modal interval. However, for the shortest prediction interval, they are not available relative to practically relevant classes of distributions. Lastly, the third part introduces consistent scoring functions for point process characteristics, such as the intensity, which enables a novel approach to comparative forecast evaluation in this framework",

Expert opinion is often elicited in the form of subjective confidence intervals; however, these are prone to substantial overconfidence. We investigated the influence of elicitation question format, in particular the number of steps in the elicitation procedure. In a 3\u2010point elicitation procedure, an expert is asked for a lower limit, upper limit, and best guess, the two limits creating an interval of some assigned confidence level (e.g., 80%). In our 4\u2010step interval elicitation procedure, experts were also asked for a realistic lower limit, upper limit, and best guess, but no confidence level was assigned; the fourth step was to rate their anticipated confidence in the interval produced. In our three studies, experts made interval predictions of rates of infectious diseases (Study 1,\u2002n\u2002= 21 and Study 2,\u2002n\u2002= 24: epidemiologists and public health experts), or marine invertebrate populations (Study 3,\u2002n\u2002= 34: ecologists and biologists). We combined the results from our studies using meta\u2010analysis, which found average overconfidence of 11.9%, 95% CI [3.5, 20.3] (a hit rate of 68.1% for 80% intervals)\u2014a substantial decrease in overconfidence compared with previous studies. Studies 2 and 3 suggest that the 4\u2010step procedure is more likely to reduce overconfidence than the 3\u2010point procedure (Cohen's\u2002d\u2002= 0.61, [0.04, 1.18]).",

While most of these protocols use methods that have focused on the precision of the elicited probabilities, the speed of the elicitation process has often been neglected. However, speed is also important, particularly when experts need to examine a large number of events on a recurrent basis. Furthermore, most existing elicitation methods are numerical in nature, but there are various reasons why an expert would refuse to give such precise ratio\u2010scale estimates, even if highly numerate. This may occur, for instance, when there is lack of sufficient hard evidence, when assessing very uncertain events (such as emergent threats), or when dealing with politicized topics (such as terrorism or disease outbreaks). In this article, we adopt an ordinal ranking approach from multicriteria decision analysis to provide a fast and nonnumerical probability elicitation process. Probabilities are subsequently approximated from the ranking by an algorithm based on the principle of maximum entropy, a rule compatible with the ordinal information provided by the expert. The method can elicit probabilities for a wide range of different event types, including new ways of eliciting probabilities for stochastically independent events and low\u2010probability events. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to test the accuracy of the approximated probabilities and try the method in practice, applying it to a real\u2010world risk analysis recently conducted for DEFRA (the U.K. Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs): the prioritization of animal health threats.",

Abstract This paper theoretically and experimentally studies decision-making in risky and social environments. We explore the interdependence of individual risk attitudes and social preferences in form of inequality aversion as two decisive behavioral determinants in such contexts. Our model and the data demonstrate that individual risk aversion is attenuated when lagging behind peers, whereas it is amplified under favorable income inequality. Moreover, people's choices are not only contextdependent, but are sensitive to their degree of inequality aversion. The majority of our experimental findings cannot be rationalized by rank-dependent utility models or cumulative prospect theory. Our results contribute to the basic understanding of the underlying principles of decision-making in environments like trading at stock markets, the saving patterns of households or charitable giving under uncertainty.

If the\nfinancial position of an institution is not acceptable, the decision maker has\nto raise new capital and invest it into a basket of so called eligible assets\nto change the current position such that the resulting one corresponds with an\nelement of the acceptance set. Risk measures have been widely studied. The risk\nmeasure that is considered here determines the minimal costs of making a\nfinancial position acceptable. In the literature, monetary risk measures are\noften defined as translation invariant functions and, thus, there is an\nequivalent formulation as Gerstewitz-Functional. The Gerstewitz-Functional is\nan useful tool for separation and scalarization in multiobjective optimization\nin the non-convex case. In our paper, we study properties of the sublevel sets,\nstrict sublevel sets and level lines of a risk measure defined on a linear\nspace. Furthermore, we discuss the finiteness of the risk measure and relax the\nclosedness assumptions.",

A lottery-equivalence questionnaire elicits a utility curve for risky payoffs which is fit to a Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) model. Secondary data from a multi-actor design experiment provides observations of strategic decisions in two-actor design games for validation. 124 participants complete the risk attitude questionnaire and a series of 29 experimental tasks. Assuming participants follow the risk dominance equilibrium selection criterion, a risk-neutral utility function accurately predicts 62.2% of decisions. Incorporating risk attitudes elicited from the questionnaire only increases the accuracy to 63.3% while incorporating risk attitudes inferred from observations increases the accuracy to 77.5%. While participants exhibit differential risk attitudes in design tasks, results show the lottery-equivalent questionnaire does not provide risk attitudes consistent with strategic design decisions. Results support findings that risk in the engineering domain is contextual. This paper concludes that risk attitude is an important factor in understanding strategic decisions in interactive engineering design settings and understanding risk attitudes can help create more efficient design processes.",

Drawing a sample from the same subject population, we find evidence that the binary lottery procedure induces linear utility in a subjective probability elicitation task using the Quadratic Scoring Rule. We also show that the binary lottery procedure can induce direct revelation of subjective probabilities in subjects with certain Non-Expected Utility preference representations that satisfy weak conditions that we identify.",

Recent studies by Solomon [1982] and Tomassini et al. [1982] investigated two conformance properties of auditors' account balance PPDs: extremeness and calibration. PPD extremeness is measured over a sequence of elicitation trials by computing the average subjective probability assigned to intervals containing the auditees' actual account values and, as such, can be viewed as a measure of predictive ability (see Seaver, von Winterfeldt, and Edwards [1978]). Calibration, in turn, is a measure of the ability to express an appropriate degree of confidence in such subjective estimates.1 Both the Solomon [1982] and Tomassini et al.

Firstly we generalize \u2014 similarly as M. Fritelli and E. Rossaza Gianin [FG05] \u2014 from the notion of coherent risk measures to the more general notion of convex risk measures as introduced by H. F\u00a8ollmer and A. Schied [FS 04]. Secondly \u2014 and more importantly \u2014 we show that the hypothesis of Fatou property may actually be dropped as it is automatically implied by the hypothesis of law invariance.We also introduce the notion of the Lebesgue property of a convex risk measure, where the inequality in the definition of the Fatou property is replaced by an equality, and give some dual characterizations of this property.",

To further counter-weigh our negative result, we show that if a property \u0393^1 is not elicitable by itself, but is elicitable conditionally on another elicitable property \u0393^0, then there is a canonical algorithm that jointly multicalibrates \u0393^1 and \u0393^0; this generalizes past work on mean-moment multicalibration.

A functional is elicitable if it is the unique minimiser of an\nexpected scoring function, and identifiable if it is the unique zero of an\nexpected identification function; both notions are essential for forecast\nranking and validation, and $M$- and $Z$-estimation. Our framework\ndistinguishes between exhaustive forecasts, being set-valued and aiming at\ncorrectly specifying the entire functional, and selective forecasts, content\nwith solely specifying a single point in the correct functional. We establish a\nmutual exclusivity result: A set-valued functional can be either selectively\nelicitable or exhaustively elicitable or not elicitable at all. Notably, since\nquantiles are well known to be selectively elicitable, they fail to be\nexhaustively elicitable. We further show that the class of prediction intervals\nand Vorob'ev quantiles turn out to be exhaustively elicitable and selectively\nidentifiable. In particular, we provide a mixture representation of elementary\nexhaustive scores, leading the way to Murphy diagrams. We give possibility and\nimpossibility results for the shortest prediction interval and prediction\nintervals specified by an endpoint or a midpoint. We end with a comprehensive\nliterature review on common practice in forecast evaluation of set-valued\nfunctionals.Comment: 46 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1907.0130",

We conceive of formal risk handling as regulating, training, and educating safety and enforcing rule compliance, while we distinguish three different informal risk\u2010handling strategies: discretionary specialization, tacit knowledge, and taking personal responsibility. We show that the formal risk\u2010handling strategy and the three informal risk\u2010handling strategies can be measured separately. Hence, we have validated the measurement of all four strategies derived from two different risk\u2010handling approaches. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the perceived use of the four strategies has different effects on unsafe behavior: formal risk handling and tacit knowledge decrease it, discretion increases it, and taking personal responsibility has no effect on unsafe behavior.",

Theoretically, they are also connected with other important behavior, such as health-related or eco-friendly behavior, but these relations have never been investigated with field data. In a large-scale experiment with 658 adolescents, we relate experimental measures of higher order risk preferences with field behavior. Field behavior is collected in an extensive survey, where we focus on general risk taking, the environmental and the health domain, particularly on addictive behavior. Using a novel method allowing the experimental elicitation of intensities of prudence and temperance, we find females behaving more risk averse, prudent and temperant, and high-ability students behaving less risk averse and temperant. We confirm previous findings on financial decision making and higher order risk preferences, and find that prudence is a strong predictor for health-related behavior: An index capturing the obsessive use of smartphones is predicted significantly by prudence, but not by risk aversion or temperance.",

As it turns out, the measures themselves are uncorrelated (both times) and, most importantly, only the questionnaire measure exhibits test-re-test stability (\u03c1 = .78), while virtually no such stability is found in the lottery-choice task. In addition, only the questionnaire measure shows the expected correlations with a Big Five personality measure and is correlated with actual risk-taking behaviour. The results suggest that the questionnaire is the more adequate measure of individual risk attitudes for the analysis of behaviour in economic (lab) experiments. Moreover, with respect to trust, the high re-test stability of trust transfers (\u03c1 = .70) further supports the conjecture that trusting behaviour indeed has a component which itself is a stable individual characteristic (Glaeser, Laibson, Scheinkman and Soutter, 2000).",

Our method, called the Most Likely Interval elicitation rule (MLI), asks the expert for an interval and pays according to how well the answer compares to the actual outcome. We show that the MLI performs well in economic experiments, and satisfies a number of desirable theoretical properties such as robustness to the risk preferences of the expert.",

Theoretically, the former produces a greater change in expected utility for risk averse agents. This paper uses two formats of a risk preference elicitation mechanism under two decision frames to test this hypothesis. After controlling for decision error, probability weighting, and order effects, subjects, on average, are slightly risk averse and prefer an increase in the expected value of a risk due to increasing the probability over a compensated increase in the reward. There is substantial across-format inconsistency but very little within-format inconsistency at the individual level.",

This has strangely been based on a linear notion of time and event space, considering the future, a mere extension of the past. Another intriguing facet of this enterprise is probably driven by the maxim that \u201cgood news is no news\u201d; therefore, more weight and prominence has been given to negative and downside forecasting, focusing on the detrimental and potentially catastrophic events. This perspective is tacitly echoed in the news media in which a significant proportion of events covered are of depressive, sinister, vile and sometimes tragic pedigree, almost to the detriment of the positivity and hope. The systematic approach to the understanding and judicious resolution of complex events practiced around the eighteenth century BC by Babylonian Asipus bears close resemblance with the risk-based paradigms in vogue nearly two millennia later. However, we argue that the public and private enterprises need to transcend beyond compliance with regulatory frameworks that typically set baseline benchmarks for acceptable performance and risk of adversity. The risk management industry in vogue today epitomises this unipolar and adversarial perspective by spending time, resource and effort in predicting and at best avoiding future incidents, accidents and their consequent losses. This is hardly a message of hope, progression and transformation. While addressing foreseeable future adversities is a rational and prudent measure, it lacks the motive force of advancement and success without which we will remain stagnant and at best free from harm or loss. We present a critique of the obsession with risk and set out a systematic and equitable framework for decision-making, supported by a new methodology for elicitation, representation, communication and resolution of real-world issues and problems. The systematic assessment principles developed here are proposed as a universal set of goals pertinent to assessment of risks arising from all systems irrespective of type, size, origin, environment and function.",

In adapting existing techniques and engineering a viable measurement system specific to Romania, there exists an important opportunity to re-evaluate the merits and shortcomings of established approaches. As a specific example, we consider the Standard Gamble (SG) method of eliciting \u201csubjective utilities\u201d related to particular health states. The re-evaluation is accomplished from three perspectives: theoretic consistency, interpretability and practicality. It is demonstrated that consistent with economic theory, the appropriate interpretation of SG derived measures is that of a Hicksian change in welfare valuation, rather than a cardinal measure of preferences. A practical consequence of the latter is that SG will necessarily produce a higher QOL value for individuals exhibiting more risk aversion. This leads us to contemplate that in fact SG may be a more appropriate methodology in other contexts, not necessarily health-related, where quality of life may indeed be correlated with the willingness to take risks.",

Abstract: Recent experimental studies suggest that risk aversion is negatively related to cognitive ability. In this paper we report evidence that this relation might be spurious. We recruit a large subject pool drawn from the general Danish population for our experiment. By presenting subjects with choice tasks that vary the bias induced by random choices, we are able to generate both negative and positive correlations between risk aversion and cognitive ability. Structural estimation allowing for heterogeneity of noise yields no significant relation between risk aversion and cognitive ability. Our results suggest that cognitive ability is related to random decision making, rather than to risk preferences.",

The framework is a\ngeneralization of several existing models, including stochastic programming,\nrobust optimization, distributionally robust optimization, etc. Using this\nframework, we study a few new models which imply probabilistic guarantees for\nsolutions and yield less conservative results comparing to traditional models.\nNumerical experiments are performed on portfolio selection problems to\ndemonstrate the strength of our models.",

This bivariate\nmeasure intends to account for the dual aspect of risk, where the magnitudes\n$x$ of $X$ tell how hign are the losses incurred, whereas the probabilities\n$P(X=x)$ reveal how often one has to expect to suffer such losses. The basic\nidea is to simultaneously quantify both the severity $m_X$ and the propensity\n$p_X$ of the real-valued risk $X$. This is to be contrasted with traditional\nunivariate risk measures, like VaR or Expected shortfall, which typically\nconflate both effects. In its simplest form, $(m_X,p_X)$ is obtained by mass\ntransportation in Wasserstein metric of the law $P^X$ of $X$ to a two-points\n$\\{0, m_X\\}$ discrete distribution with mass $p_X$ at $m_X$. The approach can\nalso be formulated as a constrained optimal quantization problem.\n  This allows for an informative comparison of risks on both the magnitude and\npropensity scales. Several examples illustrate the proposed approach.",

An overriding methodological challenge faced is how best to apply DCEs to questions involving those attributes commonly used in value elicitation exercises such as risk, time (Bansback et al. 2012) and numbers treated (Robinson et al, 2010). Flynn (2010) concluded that in developing the methods, it was important to understand more fully the preferences of individual respondents. The study reported here sets out to provide such insights by enhancing a DCE design with additional questions that allow utility values to be derived at the individual level also. The DCE presented respondents with eight pairwise risky choices to estimate aggregate utility values for three EQ-5D health states, ranging from mild to severe. The design allowed the elicitation of utility values for worse-than-dead states. Risk was represented using the stimulus used by EuroVaQ (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/eurovaq/). Three main devices were used to collect additional individual level data. Firstly we included six additional DCE questions that were not used to estimate the aggregate DCE model but allowed the utility value of one health state to be estimated at the level of the individual. These six questions provided more extensive tests of the internal consistency of the pairwise choices undertaken in the DCE. Secondly, respondents were asked three questions where the risk in one of the two treatments was fixed, and they set the risk of the other treatment (a modified SG question). These questions then allowed us to estimate utility values for all three health states. Finally, we collected respondents risk attitudes using Kuilen and Wakker\u2019s 2011 measure. 3 We collected data on a convenient sample of 59 students studying Economics or Geography at the University of London and Exeter in 2011/12. Preliminary results show that 22 of the 59 respondents gave a series of DCE responses that were internally inconsistent. We report here the implications of the results for the inclusion of risk as an attribute in DCEs and for preference elicitation more broadly.",

The alternative family of expectiles is based on squared rather than absolute error loss minimization. The flexibility and virtues of these least squares analogues of quantiles are now well established in actuarial science, econo-metrics and statistical finance. Both quantiles and expectiles were embedded in the more general class of M-quantiles as the minimizers of a generic asymmetric convex loss function. It has been proved very recently that the only M-quantiles that are coherent risk measures are the expectiles. Also, in contrast to the quantile-based expected shortfall, expectiles benefit from the important property of elicitability that corresponds to the existence of a natural backtesting methodology. Least asymmetrically weighted squares estimation of expectiles did not, however, receive yet as much attention as quantile-based risk measures from the perspective of extreme values. In this article, we develop new methods for estimating the Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall measures via high expectiles. We focus on the challenging domain of attraction of heavy-tailed distributions that better describe the tail structure and sparseness of most actuarial and financial data. We first estimate the intermediate large expec-tiles and then extrapolate these estimates to the very far tails. We establish the limit distributions of the proposed estimators when they are located in the range of the data or near and even beyond the maximum observed loss. Monte Carlo experiments and a concrete application are given to illustrate the utility of extremal expectiles as an efficient instrument of risk protection.",

Such target level is compared against the value of a risk metric, usually computed through a probabilistic safety assessment model, to decide about the acceptability of a given design, the launch of a space mission, etc. Importance measures complement the decision process with information about the risk/safety significance of events. However, importance measures do not tell us whether the occurrence of an event can change the overarching decision. By linking value of information and importance measures for probabilistic risk assessment models, this work obtains a value\u2010of\u2010information\u2010based importance measure that brings together the risk metric, risk importance measures, and the risk threshold in one expression. The new importance measure does not impose additional computational burden because it can be calculated from our knowledge of the risk achievement and risk reduction worth, and complements the insights delivered by these importance measures. Several properties are discussed, including the joint decision worth of basic event groups. The application to the large loss of coolant accident sequence of the Advanced Test Reactor helps us in illustrating the risk analysis insights.",

By contrast, the loss aversion instruments do not predict responses to loss questions. Indeed, if anything, risk instruments predict the majority of the loss questions.

This scoring function should be consistent, meaning the correct value of the functional is the Bayes act, in which case we say the scoring function elicits the functional. Recent results show that the mode functional is not elicitable. In this work, we ask whether it is at least possible to indirectly elicit the mode, wherein one elicits a low-dimensional functional from which the mode can be computed. We show that this cannot be done: neither the mode nor a modal interval are indirectly elicitable with respect to the class of identifiable functionals.",

In contrast to the traditional approach of eliciting WTP as a single value (Point-WTP), Range-WTP explicitly allows for preference uncertainty in responses. The aim of this paper is to apply Range-WTP to the domain of contingent valuation and to test for its theoretical validity and robustness in comparison to the Point-WTP. Using data from two novel large-scale surveys on the perception of solar radiation management (SRM), a little-known technique for counteracting climate change, we compare the performance of both methods in the field. In addition to the theoretical validity (i.e. the degree to which WTP values are consistent with theoretical expectations), we analyse the test-retest reliability and stability of our results over time. Our evidence suggests that the Range-WTP method clearly outperforms the Point-WTP method.",

But while the underlying normative concepts for decision making under uncertainty remain constant, the practice of applying these concepts in real\u2010world settings, as conducted by decision analysis (DA) specialists working with agencies and interested parties, has seen a major transformation in recent decades. The purpose of this article is to provide perspectives that characterize and interpret how DA practice for societal risk management questions has grown and is being transformed over the last 40 years. It addresses a series of themes for parsing changes in how DA has evolved toward more flexible approaches, moving beyond strict theoretical assumptions and constrained settings, and addresses multiple interested parties to provide insights rather than a single correct answer. The article clarifies the path from the initial DA formulation as a set of normative axioms, through gradual change into what is now the most flexible and least restrictive form of policy analysis. The article shows how the practice of DA for societal risks has become more attuned to a wide array of interests and perspectives, more behaviorally informed, more creative, and more informative for governance process. It addresses the following themes: the evolution in the basic orientation of DA, the increasingly important role of stakeholders in DA practice, the importance and value of key problem\u2010structuring techniques, and evolution in approaches for eliciting values and technical judgments.",

The results show that giving behavior in trust game is driven by other regarding preferences and not by risk-related considerations.

A questionnaire elicited cadets\u2019 (n = 136) ratings of three categories of critical incidents (threats, constraints, and suffering among civilians) on nine qualitative risk dimensions adapted from the \u2018Psychometric risk paradigm\u2019 along with perceived personal risk, general risk, security and anticipated anxiousness. Factor analyses of average responses to the nine dimensions revealed two components: dread and new risk, the former strongly correlated with anticipated anxiousness and perceived personal and general risk. In a prospective survey, peacekeepers in Kosovo (n = 766) reported frequencies of exposure to threats, constraints, and suffering among civilians, and rated their personal risk of injury, the general risk and their trust in security relative to the peacekeeping operation. The fitness of a path model relating risk perception to risk exposure was estimated with reference to data collected after two, four and six months of deployment. Results were systematic across measurements and fit-indices in suggesting support for the model. The results confirm and extend findings from previous studies on risk perception by showing the impact of both risk characteristics (qualitative dimensions) and actual risk exposure (frequencies) on subjective risk perceptions.",

The discipline of risk management has long since had to deal with the spectre of emergent risk and its inherent lack of predictability. Just as risk management considers how any number of vulnerabilities in a system may be exploited by accident or by malicious intent that preys upon exposure to otherwise independent factors, so successful requirements elicitation is beholden to the ability to recognise the need for, and define, derived requirements. In this paper we suggest that risk assessment and requirements elicitation are two manifestations of the same activity: creating trustworthy software 1 . We propose the research and development of a methodology where the two disciplines converge.",

        "abstract": "Decisions under uncertainty or with multiple objectives usually require the decision maker to formulate a preference regarding risks or trade-offs. If this preference is known, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) criterion can be applied to aggregate scenarios or objectives into a single function. Formulating this preference, however, can be challenging, as we need to make explicit what is usually only implicit knowledge. We explore an optimization-based method of preference elicitation for a risk-averse decision maker to identify appropriate non-increasing OWA weights. We follow a data-driven approach, assuming the existence of observations, where the decision maker has chosen the preferred solution, but otherwise remains passive during the elicitation process. We then use these observations to determine the underlying preference by finding the preference vector that is at minimum distance to the polyhedra of feasible vectors for each of the observations. Using our optimization-based model, weights are determined by solving an alternating sequence of linear programs and standard OWA problems. Numerical experiments show that our passive elicitation method compares well against actively having to conduct pairwise comparisons and performs particularly well when there are inconsistencies in the decision maker's choices.",

Such behavior could be generated by two different classes of decision rules: rules that are optimal conditional on utility functions departing from risk neutrality, or heuristics derived from limited cognitive processing capacities and satisficing. To discriminate among these two possibilities, we conduct an experiment that consists of a standard search task as well as a lottery task designed to elicit utility functions. We find that search heuristics are not related to measures of risk aversion, but to measures of loss aversion.",

We elicit risk preferences on a sample of 1500 French general practitioners (GPs) using two different classes of tools: scales, which measure GPs' own perception of their willingness to take risks between 0 and 10; and lotteries, which require GPs to choose between a safe and a risky option in a series of hypothetical situations. In addition to a daily life risk scale that measures a general risk attitude, risk taking is measured in different domains for each tool: financial matters, GPs' own health, and patients' health. We take advantage of the rare opportunity to combine these multiple risk attitude measures with a series of self-reported or administratively recorded medical practices. We successively test the predictive power of our seven risk attitude measures on eleven medical practices affecting the GPs' own health or their patients' health. We find that domain-specific measures are far better predictors than the general risk attitude measure. Neither of the two classes of tools (scales or lotteries) seems to perform indisputably better than the other, except when we concentrate on the only non-declarative practice (prescription of biological tests), for which the classic money-lottery test works well. From a public health perspective, appropriate measures of willingness to take risks may be used to make a quick, but efficient, profiling of GPs and target them with personalized communications, or interventions, aimed at improving practices.",

        "abstract": "Subjective probabilities are central to risk assessment, decision making, and risk communication efforts. Surveys measuring probability judgments have traditionally used open\u2010ended response modes, asking participants to generate a response between 0% and 100%. A typical finding is the seemingly excessive use of 50%, perhaps as an expression of \u201cI don't know.\u201d In an online survey with a nationally representative sample of the Dutch population, we examined the effect of response modes on the use of 50% and other focal responses, predictive validity, and respondents\u2019 survey evaluations. Respondents assessed the probability of dying, getting the flu, and experiencing other health\u2010related events. They were randomly assigned to a traditional open\u2010ended response mode, a visual linear scale ranging from 0% to 100%, or a version of that visual linear scale on which a magnifier emerged after clicking on it. We found that, compared to the open\u2010ended response mode, the visual linear and magnifier scale each reduced the use of 50%, 0%, and 100% responses, especially among respondents with low numeracy. Responses given with each response mode were valid, in terms of significant correlations with health behavior and outcomes. Where differences emerged, the visual scales seemed to have slightly better validity than the open\u2010ended response mode. Both high\u2010numerate and low\u2010numerate respondents\u2019 evaluations of the surveys were highest for the visual linear scale. Our results have implications for subjective probability elicitation and survey design.",

        "abstract": "Lesley Walls, University of Strathclyde, UK Importance of the Process for Expert Judgement Elicitation Drawing upon experience of eliciting probabilistic engineering judgement to support reliability modelling of industrial problems, this talk will examine key challenges and suggest ways of designing a robust elicitation process. An overview of our elicitation experience space will be given to provide a frame of reference. Examples of how common biases manifest themselves within technical risk and reliability applications will be described. Perceptions of engineers and managers about the role of probabilistic expert judgement in reliability modelling will be shared. The important role that theoretical frameworks play as the basis for an elicitation process design will be discussed. Oswaldo Morales Napoles & Anca Hanea, TU Delft, Netherlands Conditional rank correlation elicitation exercise Dependence measures such as rank correlations are commonly used in different types of models. Whenever field data is available these may be estimated directly from data. However, field data is often not available and structured expert judgment is sought instead. Methods for eliciting rank correlations from experts have been proposed in the past (Cooke & Goossens 1999), (Clemen et al. 1999). One option is to ask experts directly for an estimate of the rank correlation between pairs of variables. Another option is to acquire estimates of other related quantities, e.g. conditional probabilities of exceedance, probabilities of concordance or discordance. The rank correlations of interest could be then estimated using these quantities. Previous results indicate that an accurate way to obtain a subjective measure of bivariate dependence is by simply asking the experts to estimate the correlation between the two variables in question (Clemen and et al 2000). Recently non-parametric Bayesian networks have been introduced as flexible tools for high dimensional dependence modelling (Hanea et al. 2006). The input for these models consists of univariate marginal distributions and (conditional) rank correlations. In absence of field data (conditional) rank correlations have been assessed from experts through the elicitation of conditional probabilities of exceedance or ratios of rank correlations (Morales Napoles et al. 2008). To our knowledge, there is no experimental study available that would, at least, give some indication about the accuracy of estimating conditional rank correlations from experts. Even less is known about the accuracy of one method with respect to the other. In this study we describe data collected from a controlled exercise. The question of interest is whether experts can estimate more accurately conditional rank correlations through estimates of conditional probabilities of exceedence or through ratios of rank correlation coefficients. Yee Mey Goh, University of Loughborough, UK Uncertainty in Competitive Bidding \u2013 Supporting Pricing Decision with Probabilistic Models The suppliers of long-life products such as submarines and airplanes no longer simply sell these products but provide their capability or availability. This means that companies that traditionally design and manufacture long-life products now compete through the provision of a service. These companies face a high level of uncertainty due to the novelty of the process of designing and managing the contract and the long-term nature of services. As a consequence, it is difficult for companies to determine an appropriate price bid for the service, which will enable them to win the contract as well as make a profit. The research aims at supporting these companies in their pricing decision process by providing a tool that models the uncertainties at the competitive bidding stage and depicts their influence on the probability of winning the contract and the probability of making a profit. An industrial case study will be described to demonstrate the approach. Taposhri Ganguly, University of Strathclyde, UK Mathematical Aggregation of Probabilistic expert judgements Mathematical aggregation of expert judgements is one of the widely addressed topics within Bayesian statistics especially for situations when the true value of a parameter of interest is unknown and the judgements are correlated. As stated by Winkler (1981), decisions in the face of uncertainty should be based on all available information. Literature suggests that aggregating the probabilistic expert judgements would be useful especially when there are multiple experts on the same area of expertise, judging the same scenario. Further, based on the literature, it may be argued that there is a significant gap between aggregation of expert judgements where judgements are statistically dependent and there is a gap in aggregation of between and within expert judgements when multiple variables are assessed by a set of experts. We propose a mathematical model of aggregating probabilistic expert judgements, where the judgements are correlated. We assume the expert judgements to follow a Normal distribution, assuming that the experts are providing estimates of the true value of the unknown parameter. These judgements are correlated and we construct a multivariate normal likelihood function with Normal priors to estimate the posterior distribution. The dependence between and within expert judgements is captured in the construction of the covariance matrix. The model developed, is further validated by deriving the unbiased estimators of the parameters. This modelling approach demonstrates aggregation of subjective judgements when the judgements are correlated. A realistic example on data from the Forth Road bridge demonstrates this approach. Simon French, University of Warwick, UK Expert Judgment, Meta-Analysis and Participatory Risk Analysis There are three contexts in which one might wish to combine expert judgments of uncertainty: the expert problem, the group decision problem and the textbook problem. Much has been written on the first two, which have the focus of a single decision context, but little on the third. The textbook problem arises when one needs to draw together expert judgments into a decision analysis when their judgments were made originally in a context free manner or perhaps for other decision contexts. In many ways the textbook problem parallels that of performing a meta-analysis of empirical studies. However, there are differences. In this paper, we discuss those difficulties and then focus on two closely related issues: how should expert judgment studies be published so as to facilitate subsequent meta-analyses and how should such meta-analyses be performed? Tim Bedford, University of Strathclyde, UK The Moment Model Alternative to Cooke\u2019s Classical Model Quantitative expert judgement is used in many areas of risk analysis to provide assessments of uncertainty. A leading method is Cooke\u2019s classical model, which provides a way of weighting experts depending on their performance in answering so-called calibration questions. The moment method for expert judgement combination is an alternative to Cooke\u2019s method which provides a different way of calibrating experts. It has better theoretical properties in that it uses a strictly proper scoring rule, that is, an expert who wishes to maximise his score can only do so by stating what he actually believes. The method also requires the specification of weights for the calibration process. In this paper we consider a special case of the moment model that scores location and variability assessments. We provide an approach to setting the calibration weights and repeat the comparison of this moment model with Cooke\u2019s classical model we conducted earlier for this special case. Simon Blake, Durham University, UK Calculating a Health Index to make decisions on asset replacement A Distribution Network Operator in the electricity industry manages a large portfolio of ageing assets, with an annual budget for replacing those in the worst state. This is determined by allocating a health index (HI) to each asset, on a scale of 0 to 10, which takes into account a diverse range of factors including asset age, location, utilisation, inspection data and laboratory analysis. Weighting and balancing these factors is done using a complex set of formulae, derived by incorporating expert judgment as far as possible. How this is done, and the results and consequences, constitutes an informative insight into the industrial decision-making process.",

The complexity of questionnaires makes it more difficult for respondents to choose the benefit values and complicates executing the risk reduction benefit surveys in the short term for policy-makers. The purpose of this study is to propose a risk reduction benefit evaluation model that incorporates individual behavior and subjective risks. The household production function approach is employed to express the individual's expected utility function. The results indicate that the SPM benefit values might be underestimated by the marginal change in the subjective risk. The method presented in this study is flexible and can be applied to measuring various patterns of risk reduction benefits using the economic market behavior data.",

        "abstract": "Uncertainty in economics still poses some fundamental problems illustrated,\ne.g., by the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes. To overcome these difficulties,\neconomists have introduced an interesting distinction between 'risk' and\n'ambiguity' depending on the existence of a (classical Kolmogorovian)\nprobabilistic structure modeling these uncertainty situations. On the other\nhand, evidence of everyday life suggests that 'context' plays a fundamental\nrole in human decisions under uncertainty. Moreover, it is well known from\nphysics that any probabilistic structure modeling contextual interactions\nbetween entities structurally needs a non-Kolmogorovian quantum-like framework.\nIn this paper we introduce the notion of 'contextual risk' with the aim of\nmodeling a substantial part of the situations in which usually only 'ambiguity'\nis present. More precisely, we firstly introduce the essentials of an\noperational formalism called 'the hidden measurement approach' in which\nprobability is introduced as a consequence of fluctuations in the interaction\nbetween entities and contexts. Within the hidden measurement approach we\npropose a 'sphere model' as a mathematical tool for situations in which\ncontextual risk occurs. We show that a probabilistic model of this kind is\nnecessarily non-Kolmogorovian, hence it requires either the formalism of\nquantum mechanics or a generalization of it. This insight is relevant, for it\nexplains the presence of quantum or, better, quantum-like, structures in\neconomics, as suggested by some authors, and can serve to solve the\naforementioned paradoxes.",

The subjects of the within study also participate in a simple lottery choice task which arguably measures loss aversion in risky choices. We find substantial heterogeneity in both measures of loss aversion. Loss aversion in riskless choice and loss aversion in risky choice are strongly positively correlated, but on average riskless loss aversion is higher than risky loss aversion.

        "abstract": "This paper reviews the role of expert judgement to support reliability assessments within the systems engineering design process. Generic design processes are described to give the context and a discussion is given about the nature of the reliability assessments required in the different systems engineering phases. It is argued that, as far as meeting reliability requirements is concerned, the whole design process is more akin to a statistical control process than to a straightforward statistical problem of assessing an unknown distribution. This leads to features of the expert judgement problem in the design context which are substantially different from those seen, for example, in risk assessment. In particular, the role of experts in problem structuring and in developing failure mitigation options is much more prominent, and there is a need to take into account the reliability potential for future mitigation measures downstream in the system life cycle. An overview is given of the stakeholders typically involved in large scale systems engineering design projects, and this is used to argue the need for methods that expose potential judgemental biases in order to generate analyses that can be said to provide rational consensus about uncertainties. Finally, a number of key points are developed with the aim of moving toward a framework that provides a holistic method for tracking reliability assessment through the design process.",

We use March 13, 2020, when President Trump declared a national state of emergency as a time anchor to define the pre-pandemic and on-pandemic periods. The pre-pandemic experiment was conducted on February 21, 2020. There are three on-pandemic rounds conducted 10 days, 15 days, and 20 days after the COVID-19 emergency declaration. We include four different risk-preference measures. Men are more sensitive to the pandemic and become more risk-averse based on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Women become more risk-averse in the Social and Experience Seeking domains based on the results from the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) and Sensation Seeking Scales (SSS). Both men's and women's risk-preference are stable during COVID-19 based on a Gamble Choice (GC) task. The results match our hypotheses which are based on the discussion about whether the psychological construct of risk-preference is general or domain-specific. The differential outcomes between incentivized behavioral and self-reported propensity measures of risk-preference in our experiment show the caveats for studies using a single measure to test risk-preference changes during COVID-19.",

Abstract: Many important decisions are made under stress and they often involve risky alternatives. There has been ample evidence that stress influences decision making in cognitive as well as in affective domains, but still very little is known about whether individual attitudes to risk change with exposure to acute stress. To directly evaluate the causal effect of stress on risk attitudes, we adopt an experimental approach in which we randomly expose participants to a psychosocial stressor in the form of a standard laboratory stress-induction procedure: the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups. Risk preferences are elicited using an incentive compatible task, which has been previously shown to predict risk-oriented behavior out of the laboratory. Using three different measures (salivary cortisol levels, heart rate and multidimensional mood questionnaire scores), we show that stress was successfully induced on the treatment group. Our main result is that acute psychosocial stress significantly increases risk aversion. The effect is mainly driven by males; men in our control group are less risk-averse than women, which is a standard result in the literature, but this difference almost disappears when under psychosocial stress.",

However, there is little discussion or practical advice in the ecological literature regarding the application, advantages or challenges of performance weighting. In this paper we 1) illustrate how the IDEA protocol with four-step question format can be extended to include performance weighted aggregation from the Classical Model, and 2) explore the extent to which this extension improves pooled judgments for a range of performance measures. Our case study demonstrates that performance weights can improve judgments derived from the IDEA protocol with four-step question format. However, there is no a-priori guarantee of improvement. We conclude that the merits of the method lie in demonstrating that the final aggregation of judgments provides the best representation of uncertainty (i.e. validation), whether that be via equally weighted or performance weighted aggregation. Whether the time and effort entailed in performance weights can be justified is a matter for decision-makers. Our case study outlines the rationale, challenges, and benefits of performance weighted aggregations. It will help to inform decisions about the deployment of performance weighting and avoid common pitfalls in its application.",

Health economic analyses generally ignore ambiguity preferences and assume that they are the same as preferences under risk. We show how health preferences can be measured under ambiguity, and we compare them with health preferences under risk. We assume a general ambiguity model that includes many of the ambiguity models that have been proposed in the literature. For health gains, ambiguity preferences and risk preferences were indeed the same. For health losses, they differed with subjects being more pessimistic in decision under ambiguity. Utility and loss aversion were the same for risk and ambiguity. Our results imply that reducing the clinical ambiguity of health losses has more impact than reducing the ambiguity of health gains, that utilities elicited with known probabilities may not carry over to an ambiguous setting, and that ambiguity aversion may impact value of information analyses if losses are involved. These findings are highly relevant for medical decision making, because most medical interventions involve losses.",

As a basis for this discussion we introduce a set of criteria that we believe should apply to any conceptualization of terrorism risk. These criteria are based on both criteria used in other areas of risk analysis and our experience with terrorism risk analysis. That is, these criteria offer our perspective. We show that several of the suggested perspectives and definitions have weaknesses in relation to these criteria. A main problem identified is the idea that terrorism risk can be conceptualized as a function of probability and consequence, not as a function of the interactions between adaptive individuals and organizations. We argue that perspectives based solely on probability and consequence should be used cautiously or not at all because they fail to reflect the essential features of the concept of terrorism risk, the threats and attacks, their consequences, and the uncertainties, all in the context of adaptation by the adversaries. These three elements should in our view constitute the main pillars of the terrorism risk concept. From this concept we can develop methods for assessing the risk by identifying a set of threats, attacks, and consequence measures associated with the possible outcome scenarios together with a description of the uncertainties and interactions between the adversaries.",

        "abstract": "Typically, point forecasting methods are compared and assessed by means of an error measure or scoring function, with the absolute error and the squared error being key examples. The individual scores are averaged over forecast cases, to result in a summary measure of the predictive performance, such as the mean absolute error or the mean squared error. I demonstrate that this common practice can lead to grossly misguided inferences, unless the scoring function and the forecasting task are carefully matched. Effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified ex ante, or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a statistical functional, such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive distribution. If the scoring function is specified ex ante, the forecaster can issue the optimal point forecast, namely, the Bayes rule. If the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a functional, it is critical that the scoring function be consistent for it, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. A functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is strictly consistent for it. Expectations, ratios of expectations and quantiles are elicitable. For example, a scoring function is consistent for the mean functional if and only if it is a Bregman function. It is consistent for a quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear. Similar characterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles. Weighted scoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in peculiar ways. Not all functionals are elicitable; for instance, conditional value-at-risk is not, despite its popularity in quantitative finance.",

It is widely accepted that these scoring\nfunction should be strictly consistent in the sense that the expected score is\nminimized by the correctly specified forecast for a certain statistical\nfunctional such as the mean, median, or a certain risk measure. Thus, strict\nconsistency opens the way to meaningful forecast comparison, but is also\nimportant in regression and M-estimation. Usually strictly consistent scoring\nfunctions for an elicitable functional are not unique. To give guidance on the\nchoice of a scoring function, this paper introduces two additional quality\ncriteria. Order-sensitivity opens the possibility to compare two deliberately\nmisspecified forecasts given that the forecasts are ordered in a certain sense.\nOn the other hand, equivariant scoring functions obey similar equivariance\nproperties as the functional at hand - such as translation invariance or\npositive homogeneity.

        "abstract": "2002) develop an experimental design to determine the risk attitude of an individual. They use their observations to argue that increased incentives appear to change risk attitudes, leading to greater risk aversion. Popular utility functions that do not allow for such effects are therefore misspecified. Building on this finding, they estimate a flexible utility function that characterizes their aggregate data well, but that does not assume constant (absolute or relative) risk aversion. The basic Holt and Laury (2002) (HL) design should become an important tool for the interpretation and design of experiments in which risk attitudes could play a role. However, their most important result-showing the effect of scaling up the stakes of the lottery choice task-is confounded by a possible order effect. An order effect occurs when prior experience with one task affects behavior in a subsequent task. The primary methodological contribution of experiments in economics is to enhance control. Ideally, such control makes the explanatory variables of interest, in this case scale, orthogonal to other explanatory variables such as order, allowing clearer inferences about behavior than one could get from field econometric data. We argue that not controlling for order effects results in a misspecification of utility functions that is as important as that of scale. The subjects in the HL design were given sequences of three or four tasks, as shown in Table 1 . Task #1 involved choices over lotteries with a baseline level of prizes, which we will refer to as the \"1\u03eb scale.\" Task #2 involved hypothetical choices over prizes with a scaled-up level of prizes, either 20\u03eb, 50\u03eb, or 90\u03eb. Task #3 repeated task #2, but with choices that involved real payoffs. Task #4 was a return to the baseline task with real 1\u03eb prizes. In some sessions, subjects were not given task #2 or task #3. 1 What could one infer from the comparison of measured risk attitudes in the 1\u03eb and 20\u03eb tasks in HL? Unfortunately, any observed difference could be due either to the scale of the prizes involved or the task order, or some combination of both. Thus, the effect of scale is intrinsically confounded with the possible effect of task order. 2 This is a logical flaw in their design, which ). We thank the U.S. National Science Foundation for research support under grants NSF/ IIS 9817518, NSF/MRI 9871019, and NSF/POWRE 9973669 to Rutstr\u00f6 m and grant NSF/SES 021429.0 to McInnes. 1 HL recognize the possibility that wealth effects could also confound the effects of scale in an in-sample design. To handle this they use a clever device: when the subjects proceed from task #1 to task #3, they are asked if they are willing to give up their earnings in task #1 in order to play task #3. Since the stakes are so much higher in task #3, all subjects chose to do so. This means that the subjects face tasks #1 and #3 with no prior earnings from these experiments, although they do have experience with the type of task when facing task #3. No such trick can be applied for task #4, since the subjects would be unlikely to give up their earnings in task #3 in this instance. Thus the responses to task #4 have no controls for income built into the design. 2 HL are aware (p. 1647, fn. 4) of the possible effect of task order, albeit in the context of the real choices in task #3 being affected by the immediately preceding hypothetical task #2 with identical prize values. HL also included task #4 as a check for consistency of order effects for the 1\u03eb lottery. Nevertheless, the lack of a significant difference in choices between task #1 and task #4 does not prove conclusively that there are no order effects, since it is possible that subjects gave the same responses due to some sense of obligation or preference for being consistent. Moreover, there are no controls for wealth effects in their task #4. Our design does not suffer from such a confound. 897",

To better understand the unique behavioral characteristics of entrepreneurs and the causes of these mixed results, we perform a large \"lab-in-the-field\" experiment comparing entrepreneurs to managers (a suitable comparison group) and employees (n = 21288). The results indicate that entrepreneurs perceive themselves as less risk averse than managers and employees, in line with common wisdom. However, when using experimental incentivized measures, the differences are subtler. Entrepreneurs are only found to be unique in their lower degree of loss aversion, and not in their risk or ambiguity aversion. This combination of results might be explained by our finding that perceived risk attitude is not only correlated to risk aversion but also to loss aversion. Overall, we therefore suggest using a broader definition of risk that captures this unique feature of entrepreneurs: their willingness to risk losses.",

        "abstract": "Concern about the degree of uncertainty and potential conservatism in deterministic point estimates of risk has prompted researchers to turn increasingly to probabilistic methods for risk assessment. With Monte Carlo simulation techniques, distributions of risk reflecting uncertainty and/or variability are generated as an alternative. In this paper the compounding of conservatism between the level associated with point estimate inputs selected from probability distributions and the level associated with the deterministic value of risk calculated using these inputs is explored. Two measures of compounded conservatism are compared and contrasted. The first measure considered, F, is defined as the ratio of the risk value, Rd, calculated deterministically as a function of n inputs each at the jth percentile of its probability distribution, and the risk value, Rj, that falls at the jth percentile of the simulated risk distribution (i.e., F = Rd/Rj). The percentile of the simulated risk distribution which corresponds to the deterministic value, Rd, serves as a second measure of compounded conservatism. Analytical results for simple products of lognormal distributions are presented. In addition, a numerical treatment of several complex cases is presented using five simulation analyses from the literature to illustrate. Overall, there are cases in which conservatism compounds dramatically for deterministic point estimates of risk constructed from upper percentiles of input parameters, as well as those for which the effect is less notable. The analytical and numerical techniques discussed are intended to help analysts explore the factors that influence the magnitude of compounding conservation in specific cases.",

Survey data were gathered in five upstate New York communities facing environmental health \u2013 risk issues. Analysis of the five case studies and a combined dataset (N= 870) show that the credibility index was consistently reliable across all applications. Use of the resulting index is demonstrated through a comparison of the credibility of the New York State Department of Health (active in each case), the industries associated with each case, and the newspaper providing coverage of each case. The credibility index was used to predict risk judgments in a structural equation model. Overall, the analysis demonstrated that the credibility index performed consistently well across the five cases and illuminated important differences in each. As such, the index should be a useful addition to many environmental health and risk communication studies.",

        "abstract": "Inferring a decision maker's utility function typically involves an elicitation phase where the decision maker responds to a series of elicitation queries, followed by an estimation phase where the state-of-the-art is to either fit the response data to a parametric form (such as the exponential or power function) or perform linear interpolation. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric method involving Gaussian stochastic processes for estimating a utility function. Advantages include the flexibility to fit a large class of functions, favorable theoretical properties, and a fully probabilistic view of the decision maker's preference properties including risk attitude. Using extensive simulation experiments as well as two real datasets from the literature, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields estimates with lower mean squared errors. While our focus is primarily on single-attribute utility functions, one of the real datasets involves three attributes; the results indicate that nonparametric methods also seem promising for multi-attribute utility function estimation.",

We consider a consumption space equipped with an endogenous notion of abstract \u2018numeraire,\u2019 and characterize those preferences for which the quantity of numeraire needed to compensate an agent between a pair of alternatives provides a consistent, cardinal measure of the intensity of preference. This framework includes many well-known preferences over classical commodity spaces, finite or infinite horizon consumption streams, and a wide range of models of preference over uncertainty and risk as special cases. For data consisting of observed or experimentally elicited compensation differences, we develop a least squares theory for quantifying a model\u2019s predictive accuracy and estimating underlying parameters. We additionally provide a general class of explicit, non-parametric statistical tests of rationalizability by particular models for stochastic data. Applications to model selection, welfare analysis and elicitation of subjective beliefs are given.",

The method obtains rigorous error bounds even for small samples\ntaken from ill-behaved distributions. The approach taken has a natural\ninterpretation in terms of the intervals between ordered observations, where\nallocation of probability mass across intervals is well-specified, but the\nlocation of that mass within each interval is unconstrained. This formulation\ngives rise to a straightforward computational resampling method: Bayesian\nInterval Sampling.

Both utility theory (expected rational behavior; von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1947) and prospect theory, with its certainty equivalent (CE) method (expected irrational behavior; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992), assume stable behavioral patterns of risk preferences. In contrast, our research pursues the opposite proposal: Human preferences (rational or irrational) are not stable; variations in the decision context during risk elicitation determine people's preferences even when the utilities of choice options are available. Accordingly, we found evidence that decision makers reverse their risk preferences between CE tasks with logarithmically spaced certainty (unequal number of risk-averse and risk-seeking sure options) and linearly spaced certainty (equal number of risk-averse and risk-seeking sure options). The results revealed that the effect of probability range (low and high) on preferences, predicted by prospect theory, is an artifact of the logarithmically spaced sure options. When the sure options were linearly spaced, the probability range no longer influenced risk preferences, indicating a preference reversal between decision tasks. Our findings highlight a need to investigate how the predictions of descriptive decision-making theories are shaped by their risk elicitation methods.

We also show that on the domain of Choquet expected utility preferences (Schmeidler [27]) with risk neutral lottery evaluation and totally monotone capacities, proper scoring rules do not exist.

        "abstract": "A BSTRACT . Measures of risk attitudes derived from experiments are often questioned because they are based on small stakes bets and do not account for the extent to which the decision-maker integrates the prizes of the experimental tasks with personal wealth. We exploit the existence of detailed information on individual wealth of experimental subjects in Denmark, and directly estimate risk attitudes and the degree of asset integration consistent with observed behavior. The behavior of the adult Danes in our experiments is consistent with partial asset integration: they behave as if some small fraction of personal wealth is combined with experimental prizes in a utility function, and that this combination entails less than perfect substitution. Our subjects do not perfectly asset integrate. The implied risk attitudes from estimating these specifications imply risk premia and certainty equivalents that are a priori plausible under expected utility theory or rank dependent utility models. These are reassuring and constructive solutions to payoff calibration paradoxes. In addition, the rigorous, structural modeling of partial asset integration points to a rich array of neglected questions in risk management and policy evaluation in important field settings. thank the U.S. National Science Foundation for research support under grants NSF/HSD 0527675 and NSF/SES 0616746, and the Danish Social Science Research Council for research support under projects 24-02-0124 and 275-08-0289. interpretations of experimental data and the implications of the calibration critiques. 10 Andersen, Harrison, Lau and Rutstr\u00f6m [2006] examine the properties of the MPL procedure in detail, and the older literature using it.

The focus for the Centre is research into individual and strategic decision-making using a combination of theoretical and experimental methods. On the theory side, members of the Centre investigate individual choice under uncertainty, cooperative and non-cooperative game theory, as well as theories of psychology, bounded rationality and evolutionary game theory. Members of the Centre have applied experimental methods in the fields of public economics, individual choice under risk and uncertainty, strategic interaction, and the performance of auctions, markets and other economic institutions. Much of the Centre's research involves collaborative projects with researchers from other departments in the UK and overseas. Please visit http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/cedex for more information about the Centre or contact Abstract We examine the relationship between confidence in own absolute performance and risk attitudes using two confidence elicitation procedures: self-reported (non-incentivised) confidence and an incentivised procedure that elicits the certainty equivalent of a bet based on performance. The former procedure reproduces the \"hard-easy effect\" (underconfidence in easy tasks and overconfidence in hard tasks) found in a large number of studies using nonincentivised self-reports. The latter procedure produces general underconfidence, which is significantly reduced, but not eliminated when we filter out the effects of risk attitudes. Finally, we find that self-reported confidence correlates significantly with features of individual risk attitudes including parameters of individual probability weighting.

Fifty\u2010six individuals from government, industry, environmental, and general\u2010public groups completed a risk\u2010perception survey in which they evaluated 34 environmental hazards on 17 attributes and also evaluated the riskiness and acceptability of each hazard. In addition, participants reported their environmental beliefs and norms using Dunlap et al.'s revised New Ecological Paradigm Scale and modified versions of Schwartz's Awareness of Consequences and Personal Norms Scales. Group membership was predictive of participants' scores on the belief and norm scales. Factor analysis of attribute ratings (averaged across participants) revealed the anticipated three oblique factors: ecological impacts, scientific understanding, and aesthetic impacts. Factor patterns were very similar for the four stakeholder groups. Factors from the aggregate analysis were predictive of individuals' riskiness judgments, but these relationships were moderated by participants' group membership, beliefs, and norms. Compared to members of other groups, members of the general public placed less emphasis on ecological impacts and more emphasis on the other two factors when judging the ecological riskiness of hazards. To our knowledge, these results represent the first formal tests of interactions between hazard characteristics and participant characteristics in determining riskiness judgments, and illustrate how traditional psychometric analyses can be successfully coupled with individual\u2010difference measures to improve the understanding of risk perception.",

We start by simply defining risk as the product between the numerical expression of the adverse consequences of an event and the likelihood of its occurrence or the likelihood that such consequences will occur. Uncertainty in likelihood estimates and several key concepts inherent to the precautionary principle, such as sufficient certainty, prevention, and desired level of protection, are represented as fuzzy sets. The strategy described may be viewed as a simplified example of a precautionary decision process that has been chiefly conceived as a theoretical contribution to the debate concerning the precautionary principle, the quantification of its application, and the formal approach to such problems.",

The accomplishments and promise of the field are impressive, yet it has not become commonplace even in very important decisions. While human nature may pose an ultimate limitation, maintaining clarity of concept and exploiting progress in the realms of scope, skill, and efficiency should lead to more widespread use. \n \nA central conceptual distinction is that between normative and descriptive views of decision-making. We discuss the importance of maintaining this distinction in the face of attempts to compromise. \n \nThe procedures for formulating, eliciting, evaluating, and appraising the decision problem are all experiencing major improvements.

The clarity test makes sure we know what we are talking about regardless of what we are saying about it. Direct and indirect values illuminate preferences.

        "abstract": "Existing evidence shows that risk aversion and trust are largely determined by environmental factors. We test whether one such factor is peer influence. Using random assignment of MBA students to peer groups and predetermined survey responses of economic attitudes, we find causal evidence of positive peer effects in risk aversion and no effects in trust. After the first year of the MBA program, the difference between an individual and her peers' average risk aversion has shrunk by 41%. Finding no peer effects in trust is consistent with recent research showing that distinct cognitive processes govern risk aversion and trust.

        "abstract": "Health risk assessments have become so widely accepted in the United States that their conclusions are a major factor in many environmental decisions. Although the risk assessment paradigm is 10 years old, the basic risk assessment process has been used by certain regulatory agencies for nearly 40 years. Each of the four components of the paradigm has undergone significant refinements, particularly during the last 5 years. A recent step in the development of the exposure assessment component can be found in the 1992 EPA Guidelines for Exposure Assessment. Rather than assuming worst-case or hypothetical maximum exposures, these guidelines are designed to lead to an accurate characterization, making use of a number of scientific advances. Many exposure parameters have become better defined, and more sensitive techniques now exist for measuring concentrations of contaminants in the environment. Statistical procedures for characterizing variability, using Monte Carlo or similar approaches, eliminate the need to select point estimates for all individual exposure parameters. These probabilistic models can more accurately characterize the full range of exposures that may potentially be encountered by a given population at a particular site, reducing the need to select highly conservative values to account for this form of uncertainty in the exposure estimate. Lastly, our awareness of the uncertainties in the exposure assessment as well as our knowledge as to how best to characterize them will almost certainly provide evaluations that will be more credible and, therein, more useful to risk managers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

While with AHP models the introduction of scenario nodes can enrich the existing multi-criteria treatment, the introduction of multi-criteria to decision trees or decision tables can enrich the existing scenarios. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is uniquely positioned to help model situations of uncertainty and risk since it is capable of deriving scales where measures ordinarily do not exist. By allowing subjective probabilities to be elicited from knowledgeable people, we can move the decision-making framework from a situation of pure uncertainty to one of measurable risk.",

In a companion article, the authors describe the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS), a self-assessment of numerical aptitude and preferences for numbers that correlates strongly with objective numeracy. Objective. The objective of this article is to validate the Subjective Numeracy Scale using measures of subjects' capacity to recall and comprehend complex risk statistics and to complete utility elicitations. Research Design. The study is composed of 3 general public surveys: 2 administered via the Web and 1 by paper and pencil. Subjects. Studies 1 and 3 surveyed 862 and 1234 people, respectively, recruited via a nationwide commercial Internet survey panel. Study 2 involved 245 people who completed paper-and-pencil surveys in a Veterans Administration hospital. Measures. The authors tested whether one's score on the SNS predicted the likelihood of correct recall and interpretation of risk information (studies 1 and 2A) or the likelihood of effectively completing a time tradeoff or person-tradeoff utility elicitation (studies 2B and 3). In Studies 1 and 2, the authors also tested whether an objective test of quantitative ability would predict performance. Results. In all studies, survey participants with higher SNS scores performed significantly better than other respondents. The predictive ability of the SNS approached that observed for objective numeracy. Conclusions. The SNS effectively predicts both risk comprehension and completion of utility elicitations without requiring survey participants to complete time-consuming and stress-inducing mathematics tests. The authors encourage the use of the SNS in a variety of health services research contexts.",

Rational choice models require potential outcomes (e.g., benefits/costs) to be weighted by their probability of occurrence. Indeed, the subjective likelihood of being apprehended is the central construct in criminological deterrence theory\u2014the so-called certainty principle. Yet, extant literature has measured the construct inconsistently and with little attention to potential consequences. Using a series of randomized experiments conducted with nationwide samples of American adults (aged 18 and over), this study examines the degree of correspondence between verbal and numeric measures of apprehension risk, assesses the durability of numeric estimates specifically, and attempts to elicit how respondents naturally think about apprehension risk. The findings suggest that laypeople are somewhat inconsistent in their use of both verbal and numeric descriptors of probability, their numeric estimates of probability are unlikely to be precise or durable, and many seem to prefer thinking of risk in verbal terms (compared to numeric terms). Researchers should consider including both verbal and numeric measures of probability and explore alternative measurement strategies, including anchoring vignettes, which have been valuable in standardizing verbal responses in other disciplines.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between trust and risk is a topic of enduring interest. Although there are substantial differences between the ideas the terms express, many researchers from different disciplines have pointed out that these two concepts become very closely related in personal exchange contexts. This raises the important practical concern over whether behaviors in the widely-used \"trust game\" actually measure trust, or instead reveal more about risk attitudes. It is critical to confront this question rigorously, as data from these games are increasingly used to support conclusions from a wide variety of fields including macroeconomic development, social psychology and cultural anthropology. The aim of this paper is to provide cogent evidence on the relationship between trust and risk in \"trust\" games. Subjects in our experiment participate either in a trust game or in its risk game counterpart. In the trust version, subjects play a standard trust game and know their counterparts are human. In the risk version, subjects know their counterparts are computers making random decisions. We compare decisions between these treatments, and also correlate behavior with subjects' risk attitudes as measured by the Holt and Laury (2002) risk instrument. We provide evidence that trusting behavior is different than behavior under risk. In particular, (i) decisions patterns in our trust and risk games are significantly different; and (ii) risk attitudes predict decisions in the risk game, but not the trust game.

The findings suggest that lack of concern for others' risk exposure hardly requires \"financial psychopaths\" in order to flourish, but is diminished by social concerns.

T his paper proposes a new method, the (gamble-)tradeoff method, for eliciting utilities in decision under risk or uncertainty. The elicitation of utilities, to be used in the expected utility criterion, turns out to be possible even if probabilities are ambiguous or unknown. A disadvantage of the tradeoff method is that a few more questions usually must be asked to clients. Also, the lotteries that are needed are somewhat more complex than in the certaintyequivalent method or in the probability-equivalent method. The major advantage of the tradeoff method is its robustness against probability distortions and misconceptions, which constitute a major cause of violations of expected utility and generate inconsistencies in utility elicitation. Thus the tradeoff method retains full validity under prospect theory, rank-dependent utility, and the combination of the two, i.e., cumulative prospect theory. The tradeoff method is tested for monetary outcomes and for outcomes describing lifeduration. We find higher risk aversion for life duration, but the tradeoff method elicits similar curvature of utility. Apparently the higher risk aversion for life duration is due to more pronounced deviations from expected utility. many years. This paper precisely suggests a new method of utility elicitation, the \"gamble-tradeoff method,\" or \"tradeoff method\" for short. This method uses, in the context of uncertainty, a technique that has been used previously in multiattribute utility theory (the \"saw-tooth\" method in Fishburn 1967; Johnson 1974; Keeney and Raiffa 1976, ?3.4.7; Kirkwood and Sarin 1980; von Winterfeldt and Edwards 1986), conjoint measurement theory (Krantz et al. 1971; Tversky et al. 1988), and in axiomatizations of several risktheory forms (Wakker 1984 (Wakker , 1989 (Wakker , 1994 ; Tversky and Kahneman 1992; Wakker and Tversky 1993). The main advantage of the tradeoff method is that it minimizes the role of probabilities while preserving full validity when used in the expected utility criterion. Utilities can be generated when a subject distorts or misperceives probabilities, or when the subject does not understand probabilities. In the latter case, general events whose probabilities need not be known with precision can be used to elicit utilities. We would like to emphasize that we are in no way arguing that eliciting utilities with unknown probabilities is in general superior to eliciting utilities with known probabilities. Rather, we claim only that the tradeoff method enables one to elicit utilities without invoking known probabilities and that this can offer a number of advantages. The tradeoff method can perfectly well be applied when probabilities are known. The method then still provides more robustness against deviations from expected utility than existing methods. Both under the rank-dependent deviations from expected utility (Quiggin 1981; Schmeidler 1989) and under prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), does the tradeoff method not only provide robustness against probability distortions, but it even completely eliminates the effects of probability distortions. Thus, under these theories, the method generates the correct utilities. In particular the method can be applied to gains and losses in \"cumulative prospect theory\" (Tversky and Kahneman 1992), which is the modern version of prospect theory. The desirability of developing elicitation methods that remain valid for nonexpected utility models has been pointed out several times (Farquhar 1984; Loomes and McKenzie 1989; Hogarth and Einhorn 1990, p. 799; Birnbaum and Sutton 1992; Weber 1994). Tversky and Kahneman (1992, ?2.3) described the estimation of a complex choice model, such as cumulative prospect theory, as a problematic issue. Another feature of our method is that it can uncover deviations from expected utility through inconsistencies in the revealed tradeoff comparisons. Thus, the method is suited for axiomatizations of expected utility models and the rank-dependent generalizations thereof; see Wakker and Tversky (1993), Wakker (1994), and the references therein. Finally, the elicitation method can be used to elicit probabilities indirectly. The entire expected utility model can then be elicited without prior knowledge of any probability or utility. We developed the tradeoff method primarily to be applied in prescriptive decision analysis. It is then used to construct a rational and truly representative utility, where inconsistencies are to be resolved rather than accepted. The method is suited for prescriptive applications because it allows for convenient cross-checkings, and because it appeals directly to a rational decision approach: the weighing of arguments. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contrasts the tradeoff method with existing methods of utility elicitation. Section 3 describes two experiments in which utilities are elicited by means of our method, one for monetary outcomes, the other for outcomes that describe life-duration. It has often been found in the literature that risk attitudes depend on the domain and the context. We find higher risk aversion for life durations than for money. By the tradeoff method, curvature of utility can be disentangled from other aspects of risk attitude. Thus we find that the higher risk aversion for life duration is not due to curvature of utility but to more pronounced deviations from expected utility. Section 4 shows that the tradeoff method can elicit utility for a number of nonexpected utility theories. Sections 5 and 6 discuss advantages and disadvantages of the method.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the person tradeoff method has received much attention because it directs one to value health improvements of those other than one\u2019s self. As a result, several researchers have suggested that the person tradeoff measures preferences in pharmaceutical and health economic analysis more accurately than the standard gamble, which many consider the gold standard approach. However, the person tradeoff exercise as it is currently practiced assumes a riskless world where policy decisions lead to certain societal outcomes. In reality, health policy decisions are made under risk or uncertainty. Evidence suggests riskless and risky values differ for health improvements over persons. A problem with using the riskless person tradeoff method in economic evaluation of health is that the method conflates a change in the objects of measurement (i.e., a change from health gains with respect to self to gains with respect to others) with a change in the measurement context (i.e., a change from a risk context to a risk-free one). Therefore, it is wise to examine what is sacrificed by ignoring risk and uncertainty inherent in health policy decision making. Given that the choices we make in the context of risk are often different than those we make under certainty, the authors argue that if one assumes context is important, the measurement of health improvements over persons should then be carried out in the context of risk. The authors propose the application of standard methods from utility theory to carry out elicitations for valuing health improvements of others within the context of risky choices. In addition, an alternative perspective of utility is discussed that in comparison puts forth a context free notion of utility.",

        "abstract": "In two pre-registered online studies during the COVID-19 pandemic and the early 2020 lockdown (one of which with a UK representative sample) we elicit risk-tolerance for 1,254 UK residents using four of the most widely applied risk-taking tasks in behavioral economics and psychology. Specifically, participants completed the incentive-compatible Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) and the Binswanger-Eckel-Grossman (BEG) multiple lotteries task, as well as the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Task (DOSPERT) and the self-reported questions for risk-taking used in the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP) study. In addition, participants in the UK representative sample answered a range of questions about COVID-19-related risky behaviors selected from the UCL COVID-19 Social Survey and the ICL-YouGov survey on COVID-19 behaviors. Consistently with pre-COVID-19 times, we find that risk tolerance during the UK lockdown (i) was higher in men than in women and (ii) decreased with age. Undocumented in pre-COVID-19 times, we find some evidence for healthier participants displaying significantly higher risk-tolerance for self-reported risk measures. We find no systematic nor robust patterns of association between the COVID-19 risky behaviors and the four risk-taking tasks in our study. Moreover, we find no evidence in support of the so-called \u201crisk compensation\u201d hypothesis. If anything, it appears that participants who took greater risk in real-life COVID-19-relevant risky behaviors (e.g., isolating or taking precautions) also exhibited higher risk-tolerance in our experimental and self-reported risk-taking measures.",

We survey residents of the Oklahoma City area where a 2013 tornado resulted in massive damage and 24 fatalities. Our evaluation shows that risk aversion increased for those who were injured by the tornado. However, persons who lost a friend or neighbor were emboldened, experiencing reduced risk aversion. Ambiguity aversion increased for those who lost their residence or had property damage, and loss aversion increased for those who lost a friend or neighbor. Risk preferences of individual citizens in disasters are affected in important and intricate ways, and these alterations may influence choices such as how and when to rebuild private homes, businesses and invest in a region's critical public infrastructure.",

The first two differed by the population considered (students vs. general population) while the third one used a different protocol and concerned students and portfolio managers. We find quite a lot of heterogeneity at the individual level. Of principal interest was the elicitation of risk, time and ambiguity attitudes and the relationship among these (model free) measures. We find that on the student population, there is essentially no correlation. A non negligible fraction of the population behaves in an extremely cautious manner in the risk and ambiguity domain. When we drop this population from the sample, the correlation between our measures is also non significant. We also raise three questions linked to measurement of ambiguity attitudes that come out from our data sets.",

        "abstract": "Scholars have begun to explore the role of modes of information processing and related audience characteristics in reactions to risky situations and risk information.( 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20)\u201cInformation processing\u201d concerns how people attend to and consider available information: systematic processors analyze messages and situations carefully, while heuristic processors skim and use cues (e.g., opinions of trusted reference groups) for quick judgments. This article uses scenarios about a semi\u2010hypothetical industrial facility, in particular risk comparisons being considered by its manager for inclusion in a talk to the community, to explore the impact of information processing. Information insufficiency, self\u2010assessed capacity to understand information, and information\u2010seeking propensities are tested for potential effects on information processing about industrial risks by people living near industry. As well as testing established models, this article explores the additional explanatory value of involvement, relevance, and ability (Earle et al., 1990) and objective knowledge. Both existing model variables and new ones have significant effects on information seeking and information processing in this case, and partly confirm earlier results. Trumbo( 17,18) found that heuristic processors saw lower risk and systematic processors higher risk from suspected cancer clusters. In this study, reporting knowledge about local industrial risks as insufficient for one's purposes and self\u2010reported avoidance of such information both raised ratings of the facility's risk and lowered ratings of its acceptability. Neither type of information processing significantly affected risk or acceptability judgments, but both increased risk ratings and heuristic processing had more effect than systematic processing. Positive ratings of risk comparisons' clarity and meaningfulness decreased risk and increased acceptability ratings, dominated other information variables in predictive power, and exceeded risk, benefit, and trust in contribution to acceptability judgments. Despite differences across studies in designs and variables, and the embryonic development of appropriate (self\u2010reported) measures for use in field surveys, these results confirm the potential value of further research in how information seeking and processing affect risk beliefs and reactions to risk communications.",

We find that Likert scale and non-incentivised framed survey questions are not sufficient substitutes for costlier incentivised methods in rural Niger. Instead, the incentivised framed question works best while a simplified incentivised lottery question works almost as well. More risk and ambiguity averse farmers are less likely to adopt fertiliser microdosing indicating the importance of insurance and strategies to promote learning.",

In the \u00ffrst method, the experts bet with a common opponent subject to limits on their personal betting stakes, and their individual and aggregate beliefs are represented by con\u00ffdence-weighted lower and upper probabilities. This method is applicable to situations in which the events in question are discrete, few in number, and ambiguous in nature, where interest centers on the degree of consensus or dissensus and on the reconciliation of incoherence among a small group of experts. In the second method, the experts bet directly with each other as a means of reconciling incoherence, and their beliefs are represented by lower and upper risk neutral probabilities-i.e., products of probabilities and relative marginal utilities for money. The latter method is applicable to situations in which many individuals jointly assess probability distributions for large numbers of events or continuous random variables. In both methods, the fundamental concept of probability is an interpersonal one, with irreducible game-theoretic elements.",

Economic experiments have become popular to elicit farmers\u2019 risk preferences. However, previous research is inconclusive about the power of simple lotteries or survey questions to predict actual behavior of farmers. In this paper, we experimentally compare the predictive power of four different lottery tasks. In a 2 x 2 full factorial experimental design, we compare the effect of framing the task in an agricultural context vs. an abstract task, as well as the effect of incentivizing the lottery vs. not using monetary incentives. We also introduce three survey items that ask respondents to rank their risk attitude in different domains. We compare these measures against a benchmark of actual risk management instruments farmers are using. An incentivized lottery without contextual framing triggers most risk-seeking behavior among farmers. However, all four lotteries and three survey-based measures correlate only poorly with the use of actual risk management instruments such as hail insurance. Our findings cast doubt on the predictive power of commonly used risk elicitation instruments. Additional methods are necessary to establish greater external validity in the elicitation of farmers\u2019 risk attitudes.",

Scenario Planning helps decision makers in devising strategies and thinking about possible future scenarios; while MCDA can support an indepth performance evaluation of each strategy, as well as in the design of more robust and better options. One of the frameworks proposed recently, by Goodwin & Wright, suggests the use of scenario planning with multi-attribute value theory, a mathematically simple, yet extensively researched and widely employed multi-criteria method. However, so far, such framework has been presented only using hypothetical problems. In this paper we describe two case-studies where this approach was used to support real-world strategic decisions. We discuss the challenges and limitations we encountered in applying it; and suggest some possible improvements that could be made to such framework. Key-words: scenario planning, multi-criteria decision analysis, strategic decision making, risk and uncertainty. \" [Under uncertainty] there is no scientific basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever. We simply do not know. Nevertheless, the necessity for action and for decision compels us as practical men to do our best to overlook this awkward fact (...).\" John Maynard Keynes (1937)",

The main contribution of this paper is that it examines preferences using prospects with continuous distributions-a deviation from the widely used gambles with discrete probabilities. The argument put forward in this paper is that this design is at least as realistic of many real-life situations and easier to comprehend. Data were obtained from field experiments where the tasks presented to subjects were framed as gain, loss and mixed and were not exclusively monetary. The findings show that risk preferences are context dependent, implying that the argument of risk-taking being a stable personality trait is untenable. Risk (resp., ambiguity) preferences differ within and between domains. Subjects are risk-avoiding and ambiguity avoiding in the gain domain and the reverse in the loss domain. An increase in the difference between the means of the smaller and larger variance prospects increases the preference for the larger variance prospect under risk but not under ambiguity. Stake orientation with regard to which ends of the prospects are bound at zero was crucial in subjects' decisions-an important finding not observed in discrete gamble experiments.",

For natural events as relevant in applications, such a symmetry and corresponding control are usually absent, precluding traditional measurement methods. This paper introduces two indexes of ambiguity attitudes, one for aversion and the other for insensitivity/perception, for which we can control for likelihood beliefs even if these are unknown. Hence, we can now measure ambiguity attitudes for natural events. Our indexes are valid under many ambiguity theories, do not require expected utility for risk, and are easy to elicit in practice. We use our indexes to investigate time pressure under ambiguity. People do not become more ambiguity averse under time pressure but become more insensitive (perceive more ambiguity). These findings are plausible and, hence, support the validity of our indexes.",

Prospect theory in its current form offers little, if any, prediction of how or why involvement in a process should matter, although it may offer ex post interpretations of empirical findings. Well-known findings in psychology demonstrate that when subjects exercise more involvement or choice in lottery procedures, they value their lottery tickets more highly. This often is interpreted as an \"illusion of control,\" meaning that when subjects are more involved in a lottery, they may believe they are more likely to win, perhaps because they perceive that they have more control over the outcome. Our experimental design eliminates several possible alternative explanations for the results of previous studies in an experiment that varies the degree and type of involvement in lottery procedures. We find that in treatments with more involvement subjects on average place less rather than more value on their lottery tickets. One possible explanation for this is that involvement interacts with loss aversion by causing subjects to weigh losses more heavily than they would otherwise. One implication of our study is that involvement, either independently or in interaction with myopic loss aversion, may help explain the extreme risk aversion of bond investors.",

In the context of point forecasts aiming to specify a functional\n$T$ such as the mean, a quantile or a risk measure, the ideal point forecast is\nthe respective functional applied to the conditional distribution. This paper\nprovides a theoretical justification why this ideal forecast is actually a\nforecast, that is, an $\\mathcal{F}$-measurable random variable. To that end,\nthe appropriate notion of measurability of $T$ is clarified and this\nmeasurability is established for a large class of practically relevant\nfunctionals, including elicitable ones. More generally, the measurability of\n$T$ implies the measurability of any point forecast which arises by applying\n$T$ to a probabilistic forecast. Similar measurability results are established\nfor proper scoring rules, the main tool to evaluate the predictive accuracy of\nprobabilistic forecasts.",

        "abstract": "The theory of convex risk functions has now been well established as the\nbasis for identifying the families of risk functions that should be used in\nrisk averse optimization problems. Despite its theoretical appeal, the\nimplementation of a convex risk function remains difficult, as there is little\nguidance regarding how a convex risk function should be chosen so that it also\nwell represents one's own risk preferences. In this paper, we address this\nissue through the lens of inverse optimization. Specifically, given solution\ndata from some (forward) risk-averse optimization problems we develop an\ninverse optimization framework that generates a risk function that renders the\nsolutions optimal for the forward problems. The framework incorporates the\nwell-known properties of convex risk functions, namely, monotonicity,\nconvexity, translation invariance, and law invariance, as the general\ninformation about candidate risk functions, and also the feedbacks from\nindividuals, which include an initial estimate of the risk function and\npairwise comparisons among random losses, as the more specific information. Our\nframework is particularly novel in that unlike classical inverse optimization,\nno parametric assumption is made about the risk function, i.e. it is\nnon-parametric. We show how the resulting inverse optimization problems can be\nreformulated as convex programs and are polynomially solvable if the\ncorresponding forward problems are polynomially solvable. We illustrate the\nimputed risk functions in a portfolio selection problem and demonstrate their\npractical value using real-life data.",

Numerous methods have been developed to measure these preferences hypothetically in surveys, but they have yielded inconsistent results. We analyze a panel data set in which subjects have collectively answered more than 400 surveys including 15 time-preference and 36 risk-preference elicitations. We evaluate the performance of these measures using the criteria of (1) ability to predict economically important behavior and (2) distinctness from other observables. We find substantial heterogeneity in the predictiveness of the measures. The best performing measure for time-preference is a titration method, in which a sequence of adaptive binary-choice questions narrows in on a subject\u2019s indifference point, and for risk-preference it is a self-report measure of risk aversion. Using factor analysis, we find that time preferences are well explained by a single factor, but risk preferences load on multiple factors. However, the first factor loads almost entirely on self-reported risk-preference measures, and this factor explains much of the variation. The evidence can help inform researchers about which elicitation methods to include in their surveys. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, decision analysis.",

In this paper, we argue that the use of nonprobabilistic variants of cross-impact analysis is problematic in the context of risk assessment where the usual aim is to produce conservative risk estimates which may exceed but are not smaller than the actual risk level. Then, building on the characterization of probabilistic dependencies, we develop an approach to probabilistic cross-impact analysis which (i) admits several kinds of probabilistic statements about the outcomes of relevant uncertainty factors and their dependencies; (ii) maps such statements into constraints on the joint probability distribution over all possible scenarios; (iii) provides support for preserving the consistency of elicited statements; and (iv) uses mathematical optimization to compute lower and upper bounds on the overall risk level. This approach-which is illustrated with an example from the context of nuclear waste repositories-is useful in that it retains the informativeness of cross-impact statements while ensuring that these statements are interpreted within the coherent framework of probability theory.",

The framework was designed to provide necessary background information and facilitate internally consistent choices, or choices that are in line with users\u2019 prioritized objectives. In order to test different components of the decision\u2010aiding framework, a six\u2010part, 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 factorial experiment was conducted, yielding eight treatment scenarios. The three factors included: (1) whether or not users could construct their own alternatives; (2) the level of detail regarding the composition of alternatives users would evaluate; and (3) the way in which a final choice between users\u2019 own constructed (or highest\u2010ranked) portfolio and an internally consistent portfolio was presented. Participants\u2019 self\u2010reports revealed the framework was easy to use and providing an opportunity to develop one's own risk\u2010management alternatives (Factor 1) led to the highest knowledge gains. Empirical measures showed the internal consistency of users\u2019 decisions across all treatments to be lower than expected and confirmed that providing information about alternatives\u2019 composition (Factor 2) resulted in the least internally consistent choices. At the same time, those users who did not develop their own alternatives and were not shown detailed information about the composition of alternatives believed their choices to be the most internally consistent. These results raise concerns about how the amount of information provided and the ability to construct alternatives may inversely affect users\u2019 real and perceived internal consistency.",

Contrary to previous theories of the gambling effect, the present theory is consistent with stochastic dominance. It can, however, violate transitivity.

        "abstract": "<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Part 1 of this paper has discussed the uncertainties arising from gaps in knowledge or limited understanding of the processes involved in different natural hazard areas. Such deficits may include uncertainties about frequencies, process representations, parameters, present and future boundary conditions, consequences and impacts, and the meaning of observations in evaluating simulation models. These are the epistemic uncertainties that can be difficult to constrain, especially in terms of event or scenario probabilities, even as elicited probabilities rationalized on the basis of expert judgements. This paper reviews the issues raised by trying to quantify the effects of epistemic uncertainties. Such scientific uncertainties might have significant influence on decisions made, say, for risk management, so it is important to examine the sensitivity of such decisions to different feasible sets of assumptions, to communicate the meaning of associated uncertainty estimates, and to provide an audit trail for the analysis. A conceptual framework for good practice in dealing with epistemic uncertainties is outlined and the implications of applying the principles to natural hazard assessments are discussed. Six stages are recognized, with recommendations at each stage as follows: (1) framing the analysis, preferably with input from potential users; (2) evaluating the available data for epistemic uncertainties, especially when they might lead to inconsistencies; (3) eliciting information on sources of uncertainty from experts; (4) defining a workflow that will give reliable and accurate results; (5) assessing robustness to uncertainty, including the impact on any decisions that are dependent on the analysis; and (6) communicating the findings and meaning of the analysis to potential users, stakeholders, and decision makers. Visualizations are helpful in conveying the nature of the uncertainty outputs, while recognizing that the deeper epistemic uncertainties might not be readily amenable to visualizations.</p>",

Measures of multidimensional interactions quantification are hindered, among others, by two issues: 1. Interpretation difficulties, 2. the curse of dimensionality. We propose to deal with multidimensional interactions by identifying subject-matter specific \"interaction manifestations\" and then building a low-dimensional model that reproduces as close as possible such manifestations. We argue that an adequate model building approach is to build the model in the form of a cumulant generating function, i.e. to use joint cumulants as building blocks. The whole approach resembles that of probability inversion in the area of expert knowledge based risk assessment, where a discrimination is made between \"elicitation\" variables, familiar to the experts, and \"target\" (or model) variables, consisting of the more abstract parameters of a mathematical model. A synthetic example is provided to illustrate these ideas.",

Our method provides\nscores based on pairwise comparisons between the reports made by each pair of\nexperts in the group. For ease of exposition, we introduce our scoring method\nby illustrating its application to the peer-review process. In order to do so,\nwe start by modeling the peer-review process using a Bayesian model where the\nuncertainty regarding the quality of the manuscript is taken into account.\nThereafter, we introduce our scoring method to evaluate the reported reviews.\nUnder the assumptions that reviewers are Bayesian decision-makers and that they\ncannot influence the reviews of other reviewers, we show that risk-neutral\nreviewers strictly maximize their expected scores by honestly disclosing their\nreviews. We also show how the group's scores can be used to find a consensual\nreview.

Financial institutions assign risk ratings to each security they offer, and those ratings are used to guide clients and advisors to choose an investment portfolio risk that suits their stated risk tolerance. This paper compares client Know Your Client (KYC) profile risk allocations to their investment portfolio risk selections using a value-at-risk discrepancy methodology. Value-at-risk is used to measure elicited and revealed risk to show whether clients are over-risked or under-risked, changes in KYC risk lead to changes in portfolio configuration, and cash flow affects a client's portfolio risk. We demonstrate the effectiveness of value-at-risk at measuring clients' elicited and revealed risk on a dataset provided by a private Canadian financial dealership of over 50,000 accounts for over 27,000 clients and 300 advisors. By measuring both elicited and revealed risk using the same measure, we can determine how well a client's portfolio aligns with their stated goals. We believe that using value-at-risk to measure client risk provides valuable insight to advisors to ensure that their practice is KYC compliant, to better tailor their client portfolios to stated goals, communicate advice to clients to either align their portfolios to stated goals or refresh their goals, and to monitor changes to the clients' risk positions across their practice.",

        "abstract": "Existing techniques for eliciting health-state valuations incorporate both strength of preferences for health states and other values such as risk aversion or time preference. This paper presents a new methodological approach that allows estimation of a set of core underlying health-state values based on responses elicited through multiple measurement techniques. A study was undertaken in which respondents completed the visual analogue (VAS) scale, time trade-off (TTO), standard gamble (SG) and person trade-off (PTO) for a range of states. By specifying flexible parametric functions to explain responses on each measurement technique, we estimated both the underlying strength of preference values for the health states in the study and the values for a set of auxiliary parameters characterising risk attitudes, discount rates, distributional concerns and scale distortion effects in the group of respondents. This study demonstrates that it is possible to understand responses on these four different measurement techniques based on a consistent set of core values. The approach presented here can provide insights into different sources of observed variation in VAS, TTO, SG and PTO responses and facilitate appropriate adjustment of valuations elicited through different methods for use in summary health measures and economic analyses.",

In\naddition to improving the individualized expected outcome, our proposed\ncriterion takes risks into consideration, and thus the resulting IDRs can\nprevent adverse events. The optimal IDR under our criterion can be interpreted\nas the decision rule that maximizes the ``worst-case\" scenario of the\nindividualized outcome when the underlying distribution is perturbed within a\nconstrained set. An efficient non-convex optimization algorithm is proposed\nwith convergence guarantees. We investigate theoretical properties for our\nestimated optimal IDRs under the proposed criterion such as consistency and\nfinite sample error bounds. Simulation studies and a real data application are\nused to further demonstrate the robust performance of our methods. Several\nextensions of the proposed method are also discussed.",

In the absence of such guidelines, experts rely on their own knowledge to formulate opinions. This can result in large dispersions and affects the decision maker\u2019s judgment. In this situation, we wonder what the relevant elicitation techniques are and how we can help experts to express their knowledge. From literature review, it is hard to decide if elicitation techniques are equivalent or not, which justifies the reproducibility analysis that we carry out in this paper. In this study, multiple experts have been involved in order to predict the defect size in hydraulic turbines, according to four proposed elicitation techniques. The comparison between these techniques was performed based on a suggested algorithm using the area metric concept. Our Findings show that elicitation techniques with \u2018support\u2019 tend to limit variations between experts and might be suitable only when prior knowledge on the expected elicited variable is available. Otherwise, we can end up with a distorted opinion of the elicited variable and an erroneous risk assessment.",

ABSTRACT Belief Elicitation in Experiments: Is there a Hedging Problem? * Belief elicitation in economics experiments usually relies on paying subjects according to the accuracy of stated beliefs in addition to payments for other decisions. Such incentives, however, allow risk-averse subjects to hedge with their stated beliefs against adverse outcomes of other decisions in the experiment. This raises two questions: (i) can we trust the existing belief elicitation results, (ii) can we avoid potential hedging confounds? Our results instill confidence regarding both issues. We propose an experimental design that eliminates hedging opportunities, and use this to test for the empirical relevance of hedging effects in the lab. We find no evidence for hedging, comparing the standard \"hedging-prone\" belief elicitation treatment to a \"hedging-proof\" design in a sequential prisoners' dilemma game. Our findings are strengthened by the absence of hedging even in an additional non-belief elicitation treatment using a financial investment frame, where hedging arguably would be most natural.

        "abstract": "Since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, there has been a renewed interest toward quantifying more appropriately the risks involved in financial positions. Popular risk measures such as variance and value-at-risk have been found inadequate as we now give more importance to properties such as monotonicity, convexity, translation invariance, scale invariance, and law invariance. Unfortunately, the challenge remains that it is unclear how to choose a risk measure that faithfully represents the decision maker's true risk attitude. In this work, we show that one can account precisely for (neither more nor less than) what we know of the risk preferences of an investor/policy maker when comparing and optimizing financial positions. We assume that the decision maker can commit to a subset of the above properties (the use of a law invariant convex risk measure for example) and that he can provide a series of assessments comparing pairs of potential risky payoffs. Given this information, we propose to seek financial positions that perform best with respect to the most pessimistic estimation of the level of risk potentially perceived by the decision maker. We present how this preference robust risk minimization problem can be solved numerically by formulating convex optimization problems of reasonable size. Numerical experiments on a portfolio selection problem, where the problem reduces to a linear program, will illustrate the advantage of accounting for the fact that the information about risk perception is limited.",

As organizers, we were witness of how well positioned is FUR within economics and the social sciences, attracting the best talent in the field. That made the task of getting world-class keynote speakers simpler than expected. This special issue collects a representative sample of what was presented in the conference. As has been customary in the latest editions, we have a mixture of theoretical and empirical work, and both the normative and experimental sides are well represented. On the theoretical side, we would like to highlight the contribution of Duncan Luce. In Interpersonal Comparisons of Utility for 2 of 3 Types of People, he argues that there is a solution to carrying out interpersonal comparisons of utility when the theory is supplemented with a group operation of joint receipts, and expects that this approach may lay the ground for a new way to make social welfare comparisons. Other theory articles include that of V.I. Danilov and A. Lambert-Mogiliansky, who in Expected Utility Theory under Non-Classical Uncertainty extend Savage's theory of decision making under uncertainty by replacing the lattice of events by an arbitrary ortho-complemented poset. They claim that any reasonable preference on the set of bets can be represented as expected utility with respect to some belief, that is a probabilistic measure on the orthoposet of events. This issue also contains some theoretical work at the interface with finance theory. Alexandre Street works on Value-at-Risk models and publishes here his article",

If the\nforecasting mechanisms are correctly specified, a larger amount of available\ninformation should lead to better forecasts. For point forecasts, we show how\nthe effect of increasing the information set can be quantified by using\nstrictly consistent scoring functions, where it results in smaller average\nscores. Further, we show that the classical Diebold-Mariano test, based on\nstrictly consistent scoring functions and asymptotically ideal forecasts, is a\nconsistent test for the effect of an increase in a sequence of information sets\non $h$-step point forecasts. For the value at risk (VaR), we show that the\naverage score, which corresponds to the average quantile risk, directly relates\nto the expected shortfall. Thus, increasing the information set will result in\nVaR forecasts which lead on average to smaller expected shortfalls. We\nillustrate our results in simulations and applications to stock returns for\nunconditional versus conditional risk management as well as univariate modeling\nof portfolio returns versus multivariate modeling of individual risk factors.\nThe role of the information set for evaluating probabilistic forecasts by using\nstrictly proper scoring rules is also discussed.Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/13-AOAS709 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org",

Abstract This paper compares two prominent empirical measures of individual risk attitudes -the Holt and Laury (2002) lottery-choice task and the multi-item questionnaire advocated by Dohmen, Falk, Huffman, Schupp, Sunde and Wagner (2011) -with respect to (a) their within-subject stability over time (one year) and (b) their correlation with actual risk-taking behaviour in the lab -here the amount sent in a trust game (Berg, Dickaut, McCabe, 1995). As it turns out, the measures themselves are uncorrelated (both times) and, most importantly, only the questionnaire measure exhibits test-re-test stability (p = .78), while virtually no such stability is found in the lottery-choice task. In addition, only the questionnaire measure shows the expected correlations with a Big Five personality measure and is correlated with actual risktaking behaviour. The results suggest that the questionnaire is the more adequate measure of individual risk attitudes for the analysis of behaviour in economic (lab) experiments. Moreover, with respect to behaviour in the trust game, we find a high re-test stability of transfers (p = .70). This further supports the conjecture that trusting behaviour indeed has a component which itself is a stable individual characteristic (Glaeser, Laibson, Scheinkman and Soutter, 2000).

Our answer is yes. We construct simple consumer-level behavioral sufficient statistics??B-counts??by eliciting seventeen potential sources of behavioral biases per person, in a nationally representative panel, in two separate rounds nearly three years apart. B-counts aggregate information on behavioral biases within-person. Nearly all consumers exhibit multiple biases, in patterns assumed by behavioral sufficient statistic models (a la Chetty), and with substantial variation across people. B-counts are stable within-consumer over time, and that stability helps to address measurement error when using B-counts to model the relationship between biases, decision utility, and experienced utility. Conditional on classical inputs?risk aversion and patience, life-cycle factors and other demographics, cognitive and non-cognitive skills, and financial resources?B-counts strongly negatively correlate with both objective and subjective aspects of experienced utility. The results hold in much lower-dimensional models employing ?Sparsity B-counts? based on bias subsets (a la Gabaix) and/or fewer covariates, illuminating lower-cost ways to use behavioral sufficient statistics to help capture the combined influence of multiple behavioral biases for a wide range of research questions and applications.",

Expert elicitation is designed to fill gaps in data and research using structured, transparent methods. Such gaps are a significant challenge for global risk modeling. Experience with the WHO FERG expert elicitation shows that it is feasible to conduct an expert elicitation at a global scale, but that challenges do arise, including: defining an informative, yet feasible geographical structure for the elicitation; defining what constitutes expertise in a global setting; structuring international, multidisciplinary expert panels; and managing demands on experts\u2019 time in the elicitation.

Such deficits may include uncertainties about frequencies, process representations, parameters, present and future boundary conditions, consequences and impacts, and the meaning of observations in evaluating simulation models. These are the epistemic uncertainties that can be difficult to constrain, especially in terms of event or scenario probabilities, even as elicited probabilities rationalised on the basis of expert judgements. This paper reviews the issues raised by trying to quantify the effects of epistemic uncertainties. Such scientific uncertainties might have significant influence on decisions made, say, for risk management, so it is important to examine the sensitivity of such decisions to different feasible sets of assumptions, to communicate the meaning of associated uncertainty estimates and to provide an audit trail for the analysis. A conceptual framework for good practice in dealing with epistemic uncertainties is outlined and implications of applying the principles to natural hazard science are discussed.",

Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling\nrisk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.\nBallot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion\nthat the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,\nthat null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot\npolling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.\nSHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits\nfor two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested\nare both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while\nprevious methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and\n(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction\nsimplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with\nballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the \"SUITE\" approach.\nSHANGRLA works with the \"phantoms to evil zombies\" strategy to treat missing\nballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates\nsampling from \"ballot-style manifests,\" which can dramatically improve\nefficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.\nOpen-source software implementing SHANGRLA ballot-level comparison audits is\navailable.",

Risk is modeled by four alternative formulas. We empirically test these rules by observing N=690 individuals (Caucasians, bank customers and financial professionals, aged 18-88), while making risky decisions, with measurement of Skin Conductance Response. Two perspectives are assumed to evaluate portfolio efficiency: individuals uniquely consider 'money'; or they experience a 'subjective' perception of money. We find a large dominance of risk-seeking behaviors, if observed through the phenomenology of money, independently from the risk measure used. Conversely, the same individuals appear risk averter, when values include the subjective experiences, and risk is assumed to be mentally projected with standard deviation formula. These results are consistent for sub-groups of individuals, by gender, age, education and profession. Implications are severe, as a sign of unawareness of behavior under risk.",

Three hypothetical instruments are considered that differ in terms of the simplicity, context and payoff scale of the decision presented to respondents.

Results indicate that measures of risk attitudes are poorly correlated across alternative mechanisms. The strongest positive evidence of behavioural validity is found for the gamble task explicitly defined in the context and scale of farmers' economic activities pertaining to their insurance purchase decision.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)",

Prospect theory is the dominant descriptive alternative for expected utility. This paper tests whether prospect theory leads to better health evaluations than expected utility. The approach is purely descriptive: we explore how simple measurements together with prospect theory and expected utility predict choices and rankings between more complex stimuli. For decisions involving risk prospect theory is significantly more consistent with rankings and choices than expected utility. This conclusion no longer holds when we use prospect theory utilities and expected utilities to predict intertemporal decisions. The latter finding cautions against the common assumption in health economics that health state utilities are transferable across decision contexts. Our results suggest that the standard gamble and algorithms based on, should not be used to value health.",

This paper is the result of data gathered during the European Commission Project, Evacuation Responsiveness by Government Organizations (ERGO) and outlines a preliminary decision model for the evacuation decision. The illustrative model identifies levels of risk at which point evacuation actions should be taken by emergency managers in a storm surge scenario with forecasts at 12 and 9 hour intervals. The results illustrate how differences in forecast precision affect the optimal evacuation decision. Additional uses for this decision model are also discussed along with improvements to the model through future ERGO data-gathering.",

Dr. Cox in his comment claims that allocation systems based on risk reduction measures are less effective than optimizationbased methods. We agree with Dr. Cox that several of the items articulated (such as secrecy and deception) may not be captured in a risk scoring method, but in those cases, we believe that different tools are best suited for different problems, and the assumptions made about the decisionmaker, the countermeasures, and the threat intentions will be critical in determining the best approach. We also believe that Dr. Cox has mischaracterized Antiterrorism Risk-Based Decision Aid (ARDA) as being simply a \u201crisk scoring\u201d method. We promote the use of risk measures that reflect logical, thought processes, and we developed ARDA to avoid Risk = Threat \u00d7 Vulnerability \u00d7 Consequence measures in favor of a carefully elicited risk measure. Additionally, we recommend reevaluating all decisions and their end effect, considering that the adversary would update his or her intentions as a reaction to a defensive move. Accordingly, we think that a binary categorization of pure risk scoring versus optimizationbased is misleading. We would like to emphasize that our support for risk scoring methods is specifically focused on those that evaluate and prioritize risk reduction efforts, not simply rank the greatest risks. We believe that focusing resources on efforts that have the greatest risk",

        "abstract": "There are two regularities we have learned from experimental studies of choice under risk. The first is that the majority of people weigh objective probabilities non-linearly. The second regularity, although less commonly acknowledged, is that there is a large amount of heterogeneity in how people distort probabilities. Despite of this, little effort has been made to identify the source of heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore the possibility that personality type is linked to probability distortions. Using validated psychological questionnaires, we clustered participants into distinct personality types: motivated, impulsive, and affective. We found that the motivated viewed gambling more attractive, whereas the impulsive were the most capable of discriminating non-extreme probabilities. Our results suggest that the observed heterogeneity in probability distortions may be explained by personality profiles, which can be elicited though standard psychological questionnaires.",

We compare these beliefs to the forecasts from a traditional statistical model. The extent of agreement between the subjective beliefs and statistical forecasts is formally characterized, allowing risk managers to assess for themselves what confidence to place in each. Furthermore, we characterize the extent of agreement between the individuals providing subjective beliefs, to allow an evaluation of the coherence of the beliefs that experts have about these risks. Our initial results, although based on small samples in terms of numbers, point to some striking differences between the subjective beliefs of experts and statistical forecasts. The experts have a pessimistic outlook for 2013 on the risk of European and Asian equities, as well as the cost of hedging credit risk in the United States. They do not believe it is plausible to expect the prices of oil or gold to reach historic highs. In other instances, such as interest rate risk and exchange rate risk, the subjective beliefs of our CRO sample are consistent with the forecasts of statistical models, adding strength to the inferences risk managers might draw from those forecasts.",

In addition to ambiguity aversion, we confirm a-insensitivity, a new ambiguity component recently found in laboratory studies. A-insensitivity means that people insufficiently discriminate between different levels of likelihood, often treating all likelihoods as fifty-fifty, which results in the overweighting of extreme events. Our ambiguity measurements can predict real economic decisions of the subjects; specifically a-insensitivity has a negative relation with stock market participation and private business ownership. Surprisingly, ambiguity aversion is not significantly related to stock market participation, except under high ambiguity perception. Reference dependence can explain our findings, and provides a promising direction for future research on ambiguity. JEL Classification: D81, G11, D14, C83 2 Prior literature Gilboa (1987) , Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) , and Schmeidler (1989) introduced the first tractable quantitative theories of ambiguity. Their theories, and many follow-up theories, were normatively motivated (reviewed by Etner, Jeleva, and Tallon 2012). Tversky and Kahneman (1992) introduced a descriptive theory of ambiguity, adding the empirical realism of prospect theory to the axiomatically justified models of Gilboa and Schmeidler. These models, while useful points of departure, are too general for empirically fitting data. Abdellaoui et al. (2011) introduced a specified version of prospect theory, the source method, which is tractable enough for fitting data. In a lab experiment, Abdellaoui et al. measured the entire risk and ambiguity attitudes of a sample of students, taking about a half hour per subject. We propose a method of measuring ambiguity attitudes that is considerably simpler than Abdellaoui et al.'s method, making it possible to measure the ambiguity attitude of nonacademic subjects within five minutes. Our method is based on matching probabilities, and measures only three indifferences per subject. These simple measurements can, nevertheless, predict stock market participation and private business ownership. Subjective probabilities for the Ellsberg paradox after all In our experiment, we used the classical (two-color) Ellsberg (1961) urn paradox to measure ambiguity attitudes. Ellsberg's paradox considers a known urn K and an ambiguous urn A. Urn K contains 50 yellow and 50 purple balls. 1 Urn A contains 1 We did not use the classical Ellsberg colors red and black, as the color blind often cannot distinguish red from other colors.",

In this paper, we consider a situation where information on the value function and/or the weighting functions in the CPT based SR is incomplete. Instead of using partially available information to construct an approximate value function and weighting functions, we propose a robust approach to define a generalized shortfall risk which is based on a tuple of the worst case value/weighting functions from ambiguity sets of plausible value/weighting functions identified via available information. The ambiguity set may be constructed with elicited preference information (e.g. pairwise comparison questionnaires) and subjective judgement, and the ambiguity reduces as more and more preference information is obtained. Under some moderate conditions, we demonstrate how the subproblem of the robust shortfall risk measure can be calculated by solving a linear programming problem. To examine the performance of the proposed robust model and computational scheme, we carry out some numerical experiments and report preliminary test results. This work may be viewed as an extension of recent research of preference robust optimization models to the CPT based SR.",

In the present study, a new RP task with several dilemmas was explored. Each dilemma includes the initial set plus successive approximations for estimating the Indifference Value between a Secure and the expected value of an uncertain Game. The scores showed good internal consistency, reasonably test-retest reliability, and good validity. The risk propensity dilemmas (RPD) task is proposed as an addition to an ideal battery of tasks for reflecting a complex trait that should be assessed from varied perspectives, procedures, and scenarios of uncertainty. The goal of the present research is to explore the feasibility of a new tool for measuring risk propensity (RP). This trait is characterized by a willingness to take risks that ultimately is reflected in an increased probability of engaging in risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behaviors are those that involve some potential danger or harm but also provide an opportunity to obtain some benefit (Leigh, 1999). Despite its importance, RP has been traditionally difficult to define and measure as a construct, although some attempts have been made from very different perspectives (Harrison, Young, Butow, Salkeld, & Solomon, 2005). Not only is it important to assess RP in persons who have to make decisions of high responsibility and potential danger, but the factors that have an effect on decision making must also be investigated. One question of interest is why a person in a given context chooses risk-taking behavior. Another is whether some people have a relatively general and enduring disposition that produces a higher probability of their being involved in risky behaviors in varied contexts. In exploring this issue, experimenters must answer the following question: Does a risky behavior reflect a risk propensity for that individual, or is it only a specific response elicited by a situational condition? In other words, do individuals demonstrate consistent risk-taking tendencies across situations, or is risk-taking behavior determined by situational or contentThe present research received financial support from the project AENA-UAM/785001.

SSCs importance is assessed both in the design phase (i.e., before a system is built) and in the implementation phase (i.e., when the system has been built) using the same importance measures. However, in a design phase, it would be necessary to appreciate whether the failure/success of a given SSC can cause the overall decision to change from accept to reject (decision significance). This work addresses the search for the conditions under which SSCs that are safety significant are also decision significant. To address this issue, the work proposes the notion of a \u03b8\u2010importance measure. We study in detail the relationships among risk importance measures to determine which properties guarantee that the ranking of SSCs does not change before and after the decision is made.

        "abstract": "Are risk preferences stable over time? To address this question we elicit risk preferences from the same pool of subjects at two different moments in time. To interpret the results, we use a Fechner stochastic choice model in which the revealed preference of individuals is governed by some underlying preference, together with a random error. We take cumulative prospect theory as the underlying preference model (Kahneman and Tversky, Econometrica 47:263-292, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty 5:297-323, 1992). We observe that the aggregate pattern of preferences is very similar in both sessions, and it matches the results reported in the literature. Most subjects are risk averse for gains, and risk seeking for losses. However, the subjects that jointly agree with the reflection effect of prospect theory are around 50%. The percentage of individuals that change their responses across sessions is quite high, 63%. Estimating the stochastic choice model we find that 72% of the subjects have an underlying preference which agrees with the reflection effect of prospect theory. The remaining 28% are mainly classified as risk averse for both gains and losses. The results reinforce the empirical validity of the reflection effect. Deviations from the reflection effect can be attributed to noise, as well as to the existence of a fraction of risk averse subjects.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a generalized rationale for local sensitivity analysis (SA) methods that allows to solve the problems connected with input constraints. Several models in use in the risk analysis field are characterized by the presence of deterministic relationships among the input parameters. However, SA issues related to the presence of constraints have been mainly dealt with in a heuristic fashion. We start with a systematic analysis of the effects of constraints. The findings can be summarized in the following three effects. (i) Constraints make it impossible to vary one parameter while keeping all others fixed. (ii) The model output becomes insensitive to a parameter if a constraint is solved for that parameter. (iii) Sensitivity analysis results depend on which parameter is selected as dependent. The explanation of these effects is found by proposing a result that leads to a natural extension of the local SA rationale introduced in Helton (1993) . We then extend the definitions of the Birnbaum, criticality, and the differential importance measures to the constrained case. In addition, a procedure is introduced that allows to obtain constrained sensitivity results at the same cost as in the absence of constraints. The application to a nonbinary event tree concludes the article, providing a numerical illustration of the above findings.",

Abstract We investigate the decision of experimental subjects to incur the risk of revealing personal private information to other participants. We do so by using a novel method to generate personal information that reliably induces privacy concerns in the laboratory. We show that individual decisions to incur privacy risk are correlated with decisions to incur monetary risk. We find that partially depriving subjects of control over the revelation of their personal information does not lead them to lose interest in protecting it. We also find that making subjects think of privacy decisions after financial decisions reduces their aversion to privacy risk. Finally, surveyed attitude to privacy and explicit willingness to pay or to accept payment for personal information correlate well with willingness to incur privacy risk. Having shown that privacy loss can be assimilated to a monetary loss, we compare decisions to incur risk in privacy lotteries with risk attitude in monetary lotteries to derive estimates of the implicit monetary value of privacy. The average implicit monetary value of privacy is about equal to the average willingness to pay to protect private information, but the two measures do not correlate at the individual level. We conclude by underlining the need to know individual attitudes to risk to properly evaluate individual attitudes to privacy as such.",

The novelty of the method is that it is parameter-free, and thus elicits the whole individual preference functional without imposing any prior restriction. This method is used in an experimental study to elicit individual utility and probability weighting functions for monetary outcomes in the gain and loss domains. Concave utility functions are obtained for gains and convex utility functions for losses. The elicited weighting functions satisfy upper and lower subadditivity and are consistent with previous parametric estimations. The data also show that the probability weighting function for losses is more \"elevated\" than for gains.",

The\npopular explanation in terms of 'ambiguity aversion' is not completely\naccepted. On the other hand, we have recently introduced a notion of\n'contextual risk' to mathematically capture what is known as 'ambiguity' in the\neconomics literature. Situations in which contextual risk occurs cannot be\nmodeled by Kolmogorovian classical probabilistic structures, but a\nnon-Kolmogorovian framework with a quantum-like structure is needed. We prove\nin this paper that the contextual risk approach can be applied to the Ellsberg\nparadox, and elaborate a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement\nformalism' which reveals that it is the overall conceptual landscape that is\nresponsible of the disagreement between actual human decisions and the\npredictions of expected utility theory, which generates the paradox. This\nresult points to the presence of a 'quantum conceptual layer' in human thought\nwhich is superposed to the usually assumed 'classical logical layer'.",

The data are responses of a national sample of 1225 to mail surveys that include measures of several dimensions of public judgments about violent crime, automobile accidents, hazardous chemical waste, air pollution, water pollution, global warming, AIDS, heart disease, and cancer. Beliefs about who can best mitigate threats are specific to classes of threats. In general, there is little faith that experts can do much about violent crime and automobile accidents, moderate faith in their ability to address problems of global warming, and greater expectations for expert solutions to the remaining threats. People judge individual behavior as effective in reducing the threats of violent crime, AIDS, heart disease, and automobile accidents but less so for the remaining threats. Faith in more government spending is highest for AIDS and the other two health items, lowest for the trio of violent crime, automobile accidents, and global warming, and moderate for the remaining threats. For most threats, people are not distributed at the extremes in judging mitigators. Strong attitudinal and demographic cleavages are also lacking, although some interesting relationships occur. This relative lack of sharp cleavages and the generally moderate opinion indicate ample opportunity for public education and risk communication.",

Previous experimental studies have shown that these higher-order risk preferences affect the choices of individuals deciding privately on lotteries that only affect their own payoff. Yet, many risky and financially relevant decisions are made in the social settings of households or organizations. We elicit higher-order risk preferences of individuals and systematically vary how an individual's decision is made (alone or while communicating with a partner) and who is affected by the decision (only the individual or the partner as well). In doing so, we can isolate the effects of other-regarding concerns and communication on choices. Our results reveal that the majority of choices are risk averse, prudent, and temperate across social settings. We also observe that individuals are influenced significantly by the preferences of a partner when they are able to communicate and choices are payoffrelevant for both of them.",

Bondi Old Dominion University, 2007 Director: Dr. Resit Unal The level of uncertainty in advanced system design is assessed by comparing the results of expert judgment elicitation to probability and evidence theory. This research shows how one type of monotone measure, namely Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence can expand the framework of uncertainty to provide decision makers a more robust solution space. The issues imbedded in this research are focused on how the relevant predictive uncertainty produced by similar action is measured. This methodology uses the established approach from traditional probability theory and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to combine two classes of uncertainty, aleatory and epistemic. Probability theory provides the mathematical structure traditionally used in the representation of aleatory uncertainty. The uncertainty in analysis outcomes is represented by probability distributions and typically summarized as Complimentary Cumulative Distribution Functions (CCDFs). The main components of this research are probability of X in the probability theory compared to mx in evidence theory. Using this comparison, an epistemic model is developed to obtain the upper Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

A conceptual design for the Thermal Protection System (TPS) of future Crew Exploration Vehicles (CEV) is used as an initial test case. A questionnaire is tailored to elicit judgment from experts in high-risk environments. Based on description and characteristics, the answers of the questionnaire produces information, that serves as qualitative semantics used for the evidence theory functions. The computational mechanism provides a heuristic approach for the compilation and presentation of the results. A follow-up evaluation serves as validation of the findings and provides useful information in terms of consistency and adoptability to other domains. The results of this methodology provide a useful and practical approach in conceptual design to aid the decision maker in assessing the level of uncertainty of the experts.

The risk-taking propensity measures we compare are: (1) a general measure of risk-taking propensity derived from a one-item survey question (Dohmen et al., 2011), (2) a risk aversion index calculated from a set of incentivized monetary gambles (Holt & Laury, 2002), (3) a measure of risk taking derived from an incentive compatible behavioral task-the Balloon Analog Risk Task (Lejuez et al., 2002), and (4) a composite score of risk-taking likelihood in the health domain from the Domain-Specific Risk Taking (DOSPERT) scale (Weber et al., 2002). Study participants are 351 clients of health centers around Witbank, South Africa. Our findings suggest that the one-item general measure is the best predictor of risky health behavior in our population, predicting two out of four behaviors at the 5% level and the remaining two behaviors at the 10% level. The DOSPERT score in the health domain performs well, predicting one out of four behaviors at the 1% significance level and two out of four behaviors at the 10% level, but only if the DOSPERT instrument contains a hypothetical risk-taking item that is similar to the actual risky behavior being predicted. Incentivized monetary gambles and the behavioral task were unrelated to actual health behaviors; they were unable to predict any of the risky health behaviors at the 10% level. We provide evidence that this is not because the participants had trouble understanding the monetary trade-off questions or performed poorly in the behavioral task. We conclude by urging researchers to further test the usefulness of the one-item general measure, both in explaining health related risk-taking behavior and in other contexts.",

The EVIDEM framework was developed to provide pragmatic multi-criteria decision support in health care, to estimate the value of healthcare interventions, and to aid in priority-setting. The objectives of this study were to test 1) the influence of different weighting techniques on the overall outcome of an MCDA exercise, 2) the discriminative power in weighting different criteria of such techniques, and 3) whether different techniques result in similar weights in weighting the criteria set proposed by the EVIDEM framework. Methods: A sample of 60 Dutch and Canadian students participated in the study. Each student used an online survey to provide weights for 14 criteria with two different techniques: a five-point rating scale and one of the following techniques selected randomly: ranking, point allocation, pairwise comparison and best worst scaling. Results: The results of this study indicate that there is no effect of differences in weights on value estimates at the group level. On an individual level, considerable differences in criteria weights and rank order occur as a result of the weight elicitation method used, and the ability of different techniques to discriminate in criteria importance. Of the five techniques tested, the pair-wise comparison of criteria has the highest ability to discriminate in weights when fourteen criteria are compared. Conclusions: When weights are intended to support group decisions, the choice of elicitation technique has negligible impact on criteria weights and the overall value of an innovation. However, when weights are used to support individual decisions, the choice of elicitation technique influences outcome and studies that use dissimilar techniques cannot be easily compared. Weight elicitation through pairwise comparison of criteria is preferred when taking into account its superior ability to discriminate between criteria and respondents' preferences.",

A widely acceptable alternative is the use of expert judgement process.

        "abstract": "The mental models approach, a leading strategy to develop risk communications, involves a time\u2010 and labor\u2010intensive interview process and a lengthy questionnaire to elicit group\u2010level risk perceptions. We propose that a similarity ratings approach for structural knowledge elicitation can be adopted to assist the risk mental models approach. The LinkIT game, inspired by games with a purpose (GWAP) technology, is a ludic elicitation tool designed to elicit group understanding of the relations between risk factors in a more enjoyable and productive manner when compared to traditional approaches. That is, consistent with the idea of ludic elicitation, LinkIT was designed to make the elicitation process fun and enjoyable in the hopes of increasing participation and data quality in risk studies. Like the mental models approach, the group mental model obtained via the LinkIT game can hence be generated and represented in a form of influence diagrams. In order to examine the external validity of LinkIT, we conducted a study to compare its performance with respect to a more conventional questionnaire\u2010driven approach. Data analysis results conclude that the two group mental models elicited from the two approaches are similar to an extent. Yet, LinkIT was more productive and enjoyable than the questionnaire. However, participants commented that the current game has some usability concerns. This presentation summarizes the design and evaluation of the LinkIT game and suggests areas for future work.",

        "abstract": "The theory and practice of risk measurement provides a point of intersection between risk management, economic theories of choice under risk, financial economics, and actuarial pricing theory. This article provides a review of these interrelationships, from the perspective of an insurance company seeking to price the risks that it underwrites. We examine three distinct approaches to insurance risk pricing, all being contingent on the concept of risk measures. Risk measures can be interpreted as representations of risk orderings, as well as absolute (monetary) quantifiers of risk. The first approach can be called an \u201caxiomatic\u201d one, whereby the price for risks is calculated according to a functional determined by a set of desirable properties. The price of a risk is directly interpreted as a risk measure and may be induced by an economic theory of price under risk. The second approach consists in contextualizing the considerations of the risk bearer by embedding them in the market where risks are traded. Prices are calculated by equilibrium arguments, where each economic agent's optimization problem follows from the minimization of a risk measure. Finally, in the third approach, weaknesses of the equilibrium approach are addressed by invoking alternative valuation techniques, the leading paradigm among which is arbitrage pricing. Such models move the focus from individual decisiontakers to abstract market price systems and are thus more parsimonious in the amount of information that they require. In this context, risk measures, instead of characterizing individual agents, are used for determining the set of price systems that would be viable in a market.",

Based on an experiment in which 48 experienced auditors participated, three important findings were observed. First, there was no significant difference in the mean assessment of strength of evidence measured using the likelihood ratio. However, the difference in the assessed direction of evidence, that is whether the evidence is interpreted as being confirming or disconfirming, is significant for one of the cases examined. This result shows that auditors making belief-based assessments are able to assess the direction of the evidence more accurately than auditors making probability-based assessments. Third, the auditors' aggregation of evidence was not in accordance with 'AND' logic for either auditors making belief-based or probability-based assessments. These empirical results raise issues which need to be addressed in practice and in future research.",

In all three surveys subjects' risk attitudes, risk expectations, return expectations, and risk taking behavior, i.e. the proportion of wealth they are willing to invest into the stock market compared to a risk free asset, were elicited. Using this unique dataset we analyze whether risk taking, risk attitudes, and expectations change from one quarter to the other and whether the latter two have an impact on risk taking behavior. Our results indicate that risk taking behavior decreases substantially from September to December and from December to March. Similarly, risk expectations and return expectations also change substantially from one survey to the next one. In contrast, various measures of risk attitudes are fairly stable over the time periods. Interestingly, observed changes in risk taking behavior can primarily be attributed to changes in risk and return expectations but not to changes in past performance or changes in risk attitudes. Moreover, our findings are valuable for practitioners - who are urged by MiFID (2006) to elicit their customers' risk profiles and risk preferences - since we show that risk attitudes remain fairly stable and that changes in investment behavior can mainly be attributed to changes in expectations. Lastly, we illustrate that overconfidence seems to be a fairly stable construct between September and December and tends to decrease slightly from December to March.",

We draw the distinction between \u2018external\u2019 and \u2018internal\u2019 risk measures and concentrate on the latter, where we observe data in real time, make predictions and observe outcomes. It is argued that evaluation of such procedures is best addressed from the point of view of probability forecasting or Dawid\u2019s theory of \u2018prequential statistics\u2019 [12]. We introduce a concept of \u2018calibration\u2019 of a risk measure in a dynamic setting, following the precepts of Dawid\u2019s weak and strong prequential principles, and examine its application to quantile forecasting (VaR \u2013 value at risk) and to mean estimation (applicable to CVaR \u2013 expected shortfall). The relationship between these ideas and \u2018elicitability\u2019 [24] is examined. We show in particular that VaR has special properties not shared by any other risk measure. Turning to CVaR we argue that its main deficiency is the unquantifiable tail dependence of estimators. In a final section we show that a simple data-driven feedback algorithm can produce VaR estimates on financial data that easily pass both the consistency test and a further newly-introduced statistical test for independence of a binary sequence.",

        "abstract": "Detecting and preventing data leakage and data misuse poses a serious challenge for organizations, especially when dealing with insiders with legitimate permissions to access the organization's systems and its critical data. In this paper, we present a new concept, Misuseability Weight, for estimating the risk emanating from data exposed to insiders. This concept focuses on assigning a score that represents the sensitivity level of the data exposed to the user and by that predicts the ability of the user to maliciously exploit this data. Then, we propose a new measure, the M-score, which assigns a misuseability weight to tabular data, discuss some of its properties, and demonstrate its usefulness in several leakage scenarios. One of the main challenges in applying the M-score measure is in acquiring the required knowledge from a domain expert. Therefore, we present and evaluate two approaches toward eliciting misuseability conceptions from the domain expert.",

As in previous studies risk attitudes vary within subjects across elicitation methods. However, this variation can be partially explained by individual personality traits.

The emergence of the cumulative prospect theory (CPT), developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Tversky and Kahneman (1992), provides a prominent alternative to the expected utility theory. This thesis aims to provide a choice-theoretic characterization for risk changes and risk attitudes under CPT using a stochastic dominance approach. This thesis identifies a set of stochastic dominance conditions to generalize the notions of increase in risk, strong risk aversion, downside risk and downside risk aversion to accommodate risk aversion, risk seeking and downside risk aversion preferences in the CPT paradigm. This study further investigates risk measures implied by risky choice behaviour of CPT decision makers. This thesis also extends the analyses to general reference point and inverse S-shaped value functions. The stochastic dominance conditions identified in this thesis provide an approach for risk preference elicitation in the paradigm of CPT without prior knowledge on the shape of value functions or probability weighting functions, which complements to existing risk preference elicitation approaches. Consequently, the equivalence of risk measures and stochastic dominance conditions enables risk preference elicitation through pairwise comparisons of risky prospects. The implications of this work in experimental studies and optimal decision problems (e.g. portfolio choice) shed new light into the application of CPT.",

It aims at measuring the relative importance of an individual input, or a set of inputs, in determining the uncertainty of model output by looking at the entire distribution range of model output. In this article, along the lines of Plischke et al., we point out that the original moment\u2010independent SA index (also called delta index) can also be interpreted as the dependence measure between model output and input variables, and introduce another moment\u2010independent SA index (called extended delta index) based on copula. Then, nonparametric methods for estimating the delta and extended delta indices are proposed. Both methods need only a set of samples to compute all the indices; thus, they conquer the problem of the \u201ccurse of dimensionality.\u201d At last, an analytical test example, a risk assessment model, and the levelE model are employed for comparing the delta and the extended delta indices and testing the two calculation methods. Results show that the delta and the extended delta indices produce the same importance ranking in these three test examples. It is also shown that these two proposed calculation methods dramatically reduce the computational burden.",

Under VaR a single confidence level is assigned regardless of the size of potential losses. We allow for a range of confidence levels that depend on the loss magnitude. The key ingredient is a benchmark loss distribution (BLD), i.e.~a function that associates to each potential loss a maximal acceptable probability of occurrence. The corresponding risk measure, called Loss VaR (LVaR), determines the minimal capital injection that is required to align the loss distribution of a risky position to the target BLD. By design, one has full flexibility in the choice of the BLD profile and, therefore, in the range of relevant quantiles. Special attention is given to piecewise constant functions and to tail distributions of benchmark random losses, in which case the acceptability condition imposed by the BLD boils down to first-order stochastic dominance. We provide a comprehensive study of the main finance theoretical and statistical properties of LVaR with a focus on their comparison with VaR and ES. Merits and drawbacks are discussed and applications to capital adequacy, portfolio risk management and catastrophic risk are presented.",

        "abstract": "Different methods to elicit risk attitudes of individuals often provide differing results despite a common theory. Reasons for such inconsistencies may be the different influence of underlying factors in risk-taking decisions. In order to evaluate this conjecture, a better understanding of underlying factors across methods and decision contexts is desirable. In this paper we study the difference in result of two different risk elicitation methods by linking estimates of risk attitudes to gender, age, and personality traits, which have been shown to be related. We also investigate the role of these factors during decision-making in a dilemma situation. For these two decision contexts we also investigate the decision-maker's physiological state during the decision, measured by heart rate variability (HRV), which we use as an indicator of emotional involvement. We found that the two elicitation methods provide different individual risk attitude measures which is partly reflected in a different gender effect between the methods. Personality traits explain only relatively little in terms of driving risk attitudes and the difference between methods. We also found that risk taking and the physiological state are related for one of the methods, suggesting that more emotionally involved individuals are more risk averse in the experiment. Finally, we found evidence that personality traits are connected to whether individuals made a decision in the dilemma situation, but risk attitudes and the physiological state were not indicative for the ability to decide in this decision context.",

Focusing more explicitly on the potential consequences or outcomes of such behavior, risk-taking has also been conceptualized as behavior that involves some potential for harm or negative consequence to the individual, but that may also result in a positive outcome or reward (Byrnes et al. 1999; Leigh 1999). Further, the propensity to take risks exists on a continuum, with some risk-taking being adaptive, and only more extreme levels being maladaptive (Bornovalova et al. 2009). The availability of well-developed behavioral methodologies used to study risk-taking behavior and to ensure quality data that are reliable, valid, and meaningful are crucial to the advancement of our understanding of the processes underlying the development and maintenance of risk behaviors (Koffamanus & Kaplan, in press).",

This paper explores the implications of these anomalies for preference elicitation methods. Because methods that are used to inform public policy, such as contingent valuation, are based on standard preference theories, their validity may be called into question by the anomaly data. However, on a new interpretation, these anomalies do not contradict standard theory but are errors in stated preference that can be expected to disappear as people become more experienced in relevant decision environments. We explore the evidence for this interpretation and what implications follow for preference elicitation methodology.",

The tremendous cost\nof systemic risk requires the design and implementation of tools for the\nefficient macroprudential regulation of financial institutions. The current\npaper proposes a novel approach to measuring systemic risk.\n  Key to our construction is a rigorous derivation of systemic risk measures\nfrom the structure of the underlying system and the objectives of a financial\nregulator. The suggested systemic risk measures express systemic risk in terms\nof capital endowments of the financial firms. Their definition requires two\ningredients: a cash flow or value model that assigns to the capital allocations\nof the entities in the system a relevant stochastic outcome; and an\nacceptability criterion, i.e. a set of random outcomes that are acceptable to a\nregulatory authority. Systemic risk is measured by the set of allocations of\nadditional capital that lead to acceptable outcomes. We explain the conceptual\nframework and the definition of systemic risk measures, provide an algorithm\nfor their computation, and illustrate their application in numerical case\nstudies.\n  Many systemic risk measures in the literature can be viewed as the minimal\namount of capital that is needed to make the system acceptable after\naggregating individual risks, hence quantify the costs of a bail-out. In\ncontrast, our approach emphasizes operational systemic risk measures that\ninclude both ex post bailout costs as well as ex ante capital requirements and\nmay be used to prevent systemic crises.",

It has potential to distort observational correlations and thus elicits common method bias (CMB). Although it has been noted repeatedly in social science research for almost 60 years, its threat to research validity hasn\u2019t been overwhelmingly acknowledged and remains to be scrutinized. Extant empirical evidence has demonstrated the ubiquity of CMV and identified distinct factors triggering CMB, including data source, time interval, and questionnaire design. As a result, cross-sectional self-reporting surveys are particularly subjected to extensive criticism. Nonetheless, some researchers contend that measurement error and uncommon method variance can offset or alleviate the underlying detriment so that pervasive anxiety regarding CMV is exaggerated and unjustified. The measure-centric approach underlines that CMV originates from the interplay between methods and constructs, and the two-dimensional CMV risk evaluation procedure should be conducted with simultaneous consideration of method and construct. From our view, it is preferable to cultivate a balanced and impartial attitude towards CMV, embrace its existence, discard the prejudice against self-reporting, and, above all, take proactive countermeasures based on the optimization of research design.",

The framework we propose, which is based on a two-parameter optimism weighting function, is applicable to a wide range of decision-making models and renders even the simplest, such as expected utility theory, able to describe the behavior of decision-makers within a more parsimonious framework. In particular, the optimism weighting function that we introduce is formalized as a function of the volatility of the lotteries faced. This simplifies applications of the framework to financial decision-making problems. For the purpose of demonstrating this applicability, we also derive an extension to a well-known asset pricing model to elicit a measure of market sentiment in the U.S. stock market. The results lend support to the relevance of the degree of optimism, both in financial decision-making problems and in the expectations that agents have of excess returns in the market.",

We propose a generic approach by considering a hierarchical model accounting for various sources of variation as well as accounting for potential dependence between experts. We apply this approach to two problems. The first problem deals with a food risk assessment problem involving modelling dose-response for Listeria monocytogenes contamination of mice. Two hierarchical levels of variation are considered (between and within experts) with a complex mathematical situation due to the use of an indirect probit regression. The second concerns the time taken by PhD students to submit their thesis in a particular school. It illustrates a complex situation where three hierarchical levels of variation are modelled but with a simpler underlying probability distribution (log-Normal).",

The measure relies on the decomposition of systemic\nrisk into sub-components that are in turn assessed using a set of risk measures\nand their relationships. For this purpose, motivated by the development of the\nChoquet integral, we employ the RiskRank function to aggregate risk measures,\nallowing for the integration of the interrelation of different factors in the\naggregation process. The use of RiskRank is illustrated through a real-world\ncase in a European setting, in which we show that it performs well in\nout-of-sample analysis. In the example, we provide an estimation of systemic\nrisk from country-level risk and cross-border linkages.",

A Bayesian interpretation of our results suggests that it is not possible to state ex-ante the more appropriate elicitation method for a particular subject: for 1/3 of our sample WTP is preferred, for 1/3 of our sample WTA is preferred, and for the remaining 1/3 BDM is preferred.",

In some problems quantiles are elicited from experts and used for fitting parametric models, which induce non-elicited information. In some other problems comparisons are made with a quantile of an assumed model which is noncommittal to the quantile information. The maximum entropy (ME) principle provides models that avoid these issues. However, the information theory literature has been mainly concerned about models based on moment information. This paper explores the ME models that are the minimum elaborations of the uniform and moment-based ME models by quantiles. This property provides diagnostics for the utility of elaboration in terms of the information value of each type of information over the other. The ME model with quantiles and moments is represented as the mixture of truncated distributions on consecutive intervals whose shapes and existence are determined by the moments. Elaborations of several ME distributions by quantiles are presented. The ME model based only on quantiles elicited by the fixed interval method possesses a useful property for pooling information elicited from multiple experts. The elaboration of Laplace distribution is an extension of the information theory connection with minimum risk under symmetric loss functions to the asymmetric linear loss. This extension produces a new Asymmetric Laplace distribution. Application examples compare ME priors with a parametric model fitted to elicited quantiles, illustrate measuring uncertainty and disagreement of economic forecasters based on elicited probabilities, and adjust ME models for a fundamental quantile in an inventory management problem.",

[Shortfall Risk Models When Information of Loss Function Is Incomplete, GERAD HEC, Montr\u00e9al, 2018] consider a situation where a decision maker's true loss function in the definition of SR is unknown but it is possible to elicit a set of plausible utility functions with partial information and consequently propose a robust formulation of SR based on the worst-case utility function. In this paper, we extend this new stream of research to a multi-attribute prospect space since multi-attribute decision-making problems are ubiquitous in practical applications. Specifically, we introduce a preference robust multivariate utility-based shortfall risk measure (PRMSR) and demonstrate that it is law invariant and convex. We then apply the PRMSR to an optimal decision-making problem where the objective is to minimize the PRMSR of a vector-valued cost function and propose some numerical scheme for solving the resulting optimization problem in the case when the underlying exogenous uncertainty is finitely distributed. Finally, we discuss statistical robustness of the PRMSR based optimization model by examining qualitative stability of the estimator of the optimal value obtained with potentially contaminated data. A case study is carried out to examine the performance of the proposed robust model and numerical scheme.",

We find that participants' risk attitudes are consistent with the FFP when using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak procedure to elicit prices for the gambles. However, when instead relying on a simple choice-based elicitation where participants choose between the gamble and its expected value, individual decisions are not distinguishable from random choice. This sensitivity to the elicitation procedure holds both between-and within-participants, and it remains even when participants review their price and choice decisions simultaneously and are allowed to change them. Given the greater complexity of the price elicitation procedure this finding may be further evidence that an increase in cognitive load exacerbates behavioral anomalies. JEL classification: D80.",

The participants also completed a series of personality questionnaires developed in the psychology literature including the risk domains of Weber, Blais, and Betz (2002). As in previous studies risk attitudes vary within subjects across elicitation methods. However, this variation can be explained by individual personality traits. Specifically, subjects behave as though the Holt and Laury task is an investment decision while the Deal or No Deal task is a gambling decision. JEL Codes: C9, D8",

Originally, HROT was used to manage the risks associated with the nuclear power industry but it soon became apparent that other high hazard activities might benefit from HROT, too. HROT can provide risk managers an additional tool to ensure their success by enabling them to help build specific strengths within their organization. In this way, they can assist in creating a framework for safety and for empowering all within the organization to identify and fulfill their responsibilities as champions for safety. It is clear that health care has changed over the past decade. Nevertheless, the activities or methods of managing the environment have changed relatively little. In this article, the primary characteristics of high reliability are described and an assessment tool is provided that will enable the reader to determine how an organization measures up in its ability to become highly reliable. It can also assist in focusing on those attributes where the organization is the weakest so that risk managers can begin to lead the progression toward a high reliability organization (HRO) that consistently delivers safe and effective patient care.",

        "abstract": "Techniques in applied statistics play an important role in decision making and risk measures. Many practical models are inspired by empirical studies and are developed to explain observed phenomena. This issue has collected six papers devoted to this theme. The papers have been presented in the International Conference on Applied Statistics and Financial Mathematics (ASFM2010) and International Research Forum on the current global economic crisis held in December 2010 in Hong Kong, P. R. China. In the paper \u201cA heuristic method for estimating attribute importance by measuring choice time in a ranking task\u201d by Barone, Lombardo and Tarantino, a new practical method for indirectly capturing consumers\u2019 attribute is presented. It allows analysts to indirectly obtain a respondent\u2019s relative importance weights for several tested attributes through a simple and fast procedure. The method also makes it possible to overcome most of the problems related to context, survey and cognitive variables. This makes the new method more reliable than any of the existing alternatives, such as direct rating. In the paper \u201cLeast squares estimators for nearly unstable processes for functionals of long-memory noises\u201d by Chan and Liu, the asymptotic theory of the least squares estimators (LSE) for long-memory nearly unstable model when the innovation sequences are functionals of moving averages is investigated. It is shown that the limit distribution of the LSE is a functional of the Hermite Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process. In the paper \u201cFrailties and copulas, not two of a kind\u201d by Goethals, Janssen and Duchateau, a unified framework is proposed for the copula model and the different types of frailty models in order to evaluate similarities and differences between the models. The frailty effect at the event time scale is investigated. When frailties operate at the hazard level and influence the event times in a nonlinear way, it leads in some instances to counterintuitive findings. In the paper \u201cA study on the effects of skewed distributions on the performances of max-EWMA and maxGWMA charts\u201d by Teh and Khoo, a comparative study is carried out for the max-GWMA (called the maximum generally weighted moving average) chart and the max-EWMA (called the maximum exponentially weighted moving average) chart for simultaneously monitoring the process mean and/or variability. These charts find applications in statistical process control. Overall, the results show that the max-GWMA chart has lower false alarm rates for more levels of skewnesses, compared to the max-EWMA chart. In the paper \u201cConditional moments, sub-independence and independence II\u201d by Hamedani and Volkmer, a concept called sub-independence, which is defined in terms of the convolution of the distributions of random variables, is reviewed. The concept of subindependence allows the determination of the distribution of the sum of the components in a stochastic model based on the marginal distributions of the summands. This concept is much weaker than that of independence and yet can be employed to determine the distribution of the sum of random variables from their marginal distributions. In the paper \u201cA decomposition method for optimal portfolios with regime-switching and risk constraint\u201d by Liu, Yiu and Siu, an optimal investment problem for an investor who faces a dynamic risk constraint in a Markovian regime-switching environment is studied. The goal of the investor is to maximize the expected utility of terminal wealth subject to the dynamic risk constraint specified by a proportional value-at-risk (VaR). By transforming the stochastic optimal control problem associated with the optimal investment problem into a deterministic control problem, a closed-form solution to the optimal investment problem for the case of a power utility is obtained.",

One of the central questions addressed by the risk communication literature is why some individuals and organizations are trusted as sources of risk information and others are not. Industry and government often lack public trust, whereas other sources (for example, consumer organizations, the quality media, medical doctors) are highly trusted. Problematically, previous surveys and questionnaire studies have utilized questions generated by the investigators themselves to assess public perceptions of trust in different sources. Furthermore, no account of the hazard domain was made. In the first study reported here, semistructured interviewing was used to elicit underpinning constructs determining trust and distrust in different sources providing food-related risk information (n = 35). In the second study, the repertory grid method was used to elicit the terminology that respondents use to distinguish between different potential food-related information sources (n = 35), the data being submitted to generalised Procrustes analysis. The results of the two studies were combined and validated in survey research (n = 888) where factor analysis indicated that knowledge in itself does not lead to trust, but that trusted sources are seen to be characterised by multiple positive attributes. Contrary to previous research, complete freedom does not lead to trust-rather sources which possess moderate accountability are seen to be the most trusted.",

However, it is not easy to perceive all the risks objectively. As a\nresult, some risks are perceived based on subjective impression, which leads to\nrisk biases. So, our goals are (i) We clarify the risk perception of developers\nto enhance the reliability of the brainstorming, and (ii) we calibrate the risk\nassessment based on a mathematical model to make more accurate risk list. In\nthe analysis, we collected data concerning the risk perception of 69\nprofessional software developers via a questionnaire. The average number of\nyears of experience among these professionals was 18.3. Using the dataset, we\napplied factor analysis to clarify the factors that affect the evaluation of\nrisk impact. The questionnaire was based on the risk perception theory\nestablished by Slovic, in which \"dread\" and \"unknown\" are the major factor of\nrisk perception. The analysis result shows that (i) risk experience (i.e.,\nwhether a developer actually faced the risk or not) sometimes affects risk\nassessment (evaluation of risk impact), (ii) risk perception is considered to\nbe based on unknown and dread factors, and (iii) risk assessment can be\ncalibrated by a mathematical model (the average absolute error was 0.20).",

First, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of quality-adjusted life-years. For example, we describe a recently developed extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility. ECEA adds two features-measures of financial risk protection and income distributional consequences. We then discuss a further option for expanding this approach-augmented CEA, which can introduce many value measures. Neither of these approaches, however, provide a comprehensive measure of value. To resolve this issue, we review a technique called multicriteria decision analysis that can provide a comprehensive measure of value. We then discuss budget-setting and prioritization using multicriteria decision analysis, issues not yet fully resolved. Next, we discuss deliberative processes, which represent another important approach for population- or plan-level decisions used by many health technology assessment bodies. These use quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but the group decisions are reached by a deliberative voting process. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of stated preference methods for developing \"hedonic\" value frameworks, and conclude with some recommendations in this area.",

Using structured, explicit approaches to decisions involving multiple criteria can improve the quality of decision making. A set of techniques, known under the collective heading, multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), are useful for this purpose. In 2014, ISPOR established an Emerging Good Practices Task Force. The task force's first report defined MCDA, provided examples of its use in health care, described the key steps, and provided an overview of the principal methods of MCDA. This second task force report provides emerging good-practice guidance on the implementation of MCDA to support health care decisions. The report includes: a checklist to support the design, implementation and review of an MCDA; guidance to support the implementation of the checklist; the order in which the steps should be implemented; illustrates how to incorporate budget constraints into an MCDA; provides an overview of the skills and resources, including available software, required to implement MCDA; and future research directions.",

Therefore risk assessment and risk modelling are important to support farm-level decision-making. This paper (I) reviews the techniques to elicit risk perception and risk attitude, and (2) describes how the simultaneous impact of risk perception and risk attitude could be accounted for in risk programming. Although inherent in catastrophic risks, objective data are sparse and eliciting subjective data is likely to be flawed. The review shows that the negative impact resulting from catastrophes cannot be ignored without compromising the optimal decision.",

Research examining public trust of risk managers has largely focused on trust that is unspecified or for a single goal. Yet it can be reasonable to have a high level of trust in one aspect of a target's performance but not another. Two studies involving redevelopment of contaminated land (Study 1) and drinking water standards (Study 2) present preliminary evidence on the value of distinguishing between performance criteria for understanding of trust. Study 1 assessed perceptions of several trust targets (councilors, developers, scientists, residents) on their competence (capacity to achieve goals) and willingness to take action under uncertainty for four criteria. Study 2 assessed competence, willingness, and trust for five criteria regarding a single government agency. In both studies overall trust in each target was significantly better explained by considering perceptions of their performance on multiple criteria than on the single criterion of public health. In Study 1, the influence of criteria also varied plausibly across trust targets (e.g., willingness to act under uncertainty increased trust in developers on cost control and councilors on local economic improvement, but decreased it for both targets on environmental protection). Study 2 showed that explained variance in trust increased with both dimension\u2010 and trust\u2010based measures of criteria. Further conceptual and methodological development of the notion of multiple trust criteria could benefit our understanding of stated trust judgments.",

Consequently, risk experts are actively\nseeking for ways to relax the risk independence assumption that undermines\ntypical risk management models. Prominent work has advocated the use of risk\nnetworks as a way forward. Yet, the inevitable biases introduced during the\ngeneration of these survey-based risk networks limit our ability to examine\ntheir topology, and in turn challenge the utility of the very notion of a risk\nnetwork. To alleviate these concerns, we proposed an alternative methodology\nfor generating weighted risk networks. We subsequently applied this methodology\nto an empirical dataset of financial data. This paper reports our findings on\nthe study of the topology of the resulting risk network. We observed a modular\ntopology, and reasoned on its use as a robust risk classification framework.\nUsing these modules, we highlight a tendency of specialization during the risk\nidentification process, with some firms being solely focused on a subset of the\navailable risk classes. Finally, we considered the independent and systemic\nimpact of some risks and attributed possible mismatches to their emerging\nnature.",

This approach is based on causal networks, which have previously been applied to other fields, such as systems maintenance and reliability. Causal networks allow analysts to causally explain the values of variables (an explanatory approach), to assess the effect of interventions on the structure of the data-generating process, and to evaluate Bwhat-if[ scenarios, that is, alternative methods or policies (an exploratory approach). Building the causal structure raises some challenges. In particular, there is no automated way to collect the needed data. We present a methodology for model selection and probability elicitation based on expert knowledge. We apply the proposed approach to the case of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. The use of such networks allows for a more rigorous comparison of practices across different manufacturing sites, creates the opportunity for risk remediation, and allows us to evaluate alternative methods and approaches.",

We find that an individual's risk aversion changes systematically in response to personal economic circumstances. Risk aversion increases with lengthening spells of employment and time out of labor force, and decreases with lengthening unemployment spells. However, the most important result is that the majority of the variation in risk aversion is due to changes in measured individual tastes over time and not to variation across individuals. These findings that measured risk preferences are endogenous and subject to substantial measurement errors suggest caution in interpreting coefficients in models relying on contemporaneous, one-time measures of risk preferences.",

A questionnaire study (n= 172) was used to explore the relationships between experience and risk perceptions in relation to 16 risk activities. It was expected that these relationships would differ for voluntary and involuntary activities. Measures of experience included assessments of \u201cimpact\u201d and \u201coutcome\u201d valence as well as \u201cfrequency.\u201d These three aspects of experience each related to risk assessment but their relationship depended on whether the risk experiences were voluntary or not.

In these methods, money is utilized as the scale that reflects the individual's underlying utility function. However, this scale can vary across individuals due to different perceptions on what are the right or appropriate bounds for willingness to pay. In this paper we test for scale perception bias and propose a correction method based on the utilization of anchoring vignettes that define different degrees of preference for the non-market good. The proposed method is applied to study the commonly found anomaly \"probability neglect\", which is defined by the insensitivity to the probability levels in the valuation of environmental risks. The results show that probability neglect disappears when willingness to pay responses are corrected for self-perception bias through the utilization of the anchoring vignettes approach.",

In the quantification of a risk, a number of problems arise in the public sector where multiple stakeholders are involved. In this article, I describe different approaches to the treatments of uncertainties in risk analysis, their implications for risk ranking, and the role of risk analysis results in the context of a safety decision process. I also discuss the implications of adopting conservative hypotheses before proceeding to what is, in essence, a conditional uncertainty analysis, and I explore some implications of different levels of ``conservatism'' for the ranking of risk mitigation measures.",

We find\nthat all of the algorithms perform sufficiently well on a quantum simulator.\nFurther, the calculations of expectiles and VaR are robust against noise on a\nreal quantum device. This is not the case for ES and RVaR.",

These instruments are designed to measure 5 psychological constructs we consider especially relevant: 1) attitudes, 2) feelings, 3) familiarity with the target good, 4) risk attitudes and 5) personality. Our results provide important new insights into the psychological foundations of the WTA-WTP disparity, which can be used to organize some major previous results and cast serious doubts on the claim that the gap might be just a consequence of inappropriate experimental practice.

In our approach\nthe time consistency is studied for a large class of maps that are postulated\nto satisfy only two properties -- monotonicity and locality. The time\nconsistency is defined in terms of an update rule. The form of the update rule\nintroduced here is novel, and is perfectly suited for developing the unifying\nframework that is worked out in this paper.

Quantification of operational risk\ncannot be based only on historical data but should involve scenario analysis.\nHistorical internal operational risk loss data have limited ability to predict\nfuture behaviour moreover, banks do not have enough internal data to estimate\nlow frequency high impact events adequately. Historical external data are\ndifficult to use due to different volumes and other factors. In addition,\ninternal and external data have a survival bias, since typically one does not\nhave data of all collapsed companies. The idea of scenario analysis is to\nestimate frequency and severity of risk events via expert opinions taking into\naccount bank environment factors with reference to events that have occurred\n(or may have occurred) in other banks. Scenario analysis is forward looking and\ncan reflect changes in the banking environment. It is important to not only\nquantify the operational risk capital but also provide incentives to business\nunits to improve their risk management policies, which can be accomplished\nthrough scenario analysis. By itself, scenario analysis is very subjective but\ncombined with loss data it is a powerful tool to estimate operational risk\nlosses. Bayesian inference is a statistical technique well suited for combining\nexpert opinions and historical data.

Both economists and psychologists developed several methodologies to elicit and assess individual risk attitude, but these are not perfect and show several drawbacks when used in practice. Thanks to a unique database of around 15,000 investors, this paper combines survey-based evidence with revealed preferences based upon observed asset allocation. This paper confirms some results known in the literature like the gender and age differences in risk-taking. Moreover, the behavioral clustering approach used for the analysis is useful in an inferential framework. The segments built starting from the questionnaire permit to \"forecast\" the individual risk attitude that is described by the individual choices in terms of asset allocation. Loss aversion per se is a relevant variable in explaining financial risk-taking.",

Credit scores are estimated using an online FICO credit score estimator based on survey data supplied by the participants. Preferences are assessed using a survey measure of impulsivity, with experimental measures of time and risk preferences, as well as trustworthiness.

        "abstract": "Forecasting of risk measures is an important part of risk management for financial institutions. Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall are two commonly used risk measures and accurately predicting these risk measures enables financial institutions to plan adequately for possible losses. Point forecasts from different methods can be compared using consistent scoring functions, provided the underlying functional to be forecasted is elicitable. It has been shown that the choice of a scoring function from the family of consistent scoring functions does not influence the ranking of forecasting methods as long as the underlying model is correctly specified and nested information sets are used. However, in practice, these conditions do not hold, which may lead to discrepancies in the ranking of methods under different scoring functions. We investigate the choice of scoring functions in the face of model misspecification, parameter estimation error and nonnested information sets. We concentrate on the family of homogeneous consistent scoring functions for Value-at-Risk and the pair of Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall and identify conditions required for existence of the expectation of these scoring functions. We also assess the finite-sample properties of the Diebold-Mario Test, as well as examine how these scoring functions penalize for over-prediction and under-prediction with the aid of simulation studies.",

In contrast to the literature, we find that 55% of subjects prefer a risky act to an ambiguous act that always provides a larger probability of winning. Our experimental design shows that such a preference is not mainly due to a lack of understanding. We conclude that subjects avoid ambiguity per se rather than avoiding ambiguity because it may yield a worse outcome. Such behavior cannot be reconciled with existing models of ambiguity aversion in a straightforward manner.",

Progress in this\ntask requires fixing a definition of fairness, and there have been several\nproposals in this regard over the past few years. Several of these, however,\nassume either binary sensitive features (thus precluding categorical or\nreal-valued sensitive groups), or result in non-convex objectives (thus\nadversely affecting the optimisation landscape). In this paper, we propose a\nnew definition of fairness that generalises some existing proposals, while\nallowing for generic sensitive features and resulting in a convex objective.\nThe key idea is to enforce that the expected losses (or risks) across each\nsubgroup induced by the sensitive feature are commensurate. We show how this\nrelates to the rich literature on risk measures from mathematical finance. As a\nspecial case, this leads to a new convex fairness-aware objective based on\nminimising the conditional value at risk (CVaR).",

Glaeser et al. (2000) question the validity of this measure by showing that it is not correlated with senders' behavior in the standard trust game, but only with his trustworthiness. By using a large sample of German households, Fehr et al. (2003) find the opposite result: WVS-like measures of trust are correlated with the sender's behavior, but not with its trustworthiness. In this paper we resolve this puzzle by recognizing that trust has two components: a beliefbased one and a preference based one. While the sender behavior's reflects both, we show that WVS-like measures capture mostly the belief-based component, while questions on past trusting behavior are better at capturing the preference component of trust.",

In this work, we focus on linear regression procedures and\nseek to extend the existing measures to a heteroscedastic setting. Our analysis\nof the weighted least squares method reveals some interesting properties of the\nextended measures. In particular, we find that they depend on both the weights\nused for model fitting and those for model evaluation. Moreover, modeling\nheteroscedastic data with optimal weights generally results in fewer degrees of\nfreedom than with equal weights, and the size of reduction depends on the\nunevenness of error variance. This provides additional insights into weighted\nmodeling procedures that are useful in risk estimation and model selection.",

Yet, experimental research aimed at eliciting realistic rates will inevitably require strong assumptions of external validity, while also placing large cognitive demands on subjects by processing tasks of increased unfamiliarity. We use a controlled lab experiment to test the impact of incentives on risk aversion and discounting tasks for monetary and environmental goods. We find that, on average, incentives have little effect on risk aversion or discounting tasks in either domain. Exploring heterogeneity by treatment and socio-demographics some significant patterns emerge. Further, contrary to past work, we find evidence of domain (monetary vs. environmental good) effects in both risk and discounting.",

These\nare models where a decision must be made with consideration for how an\nintelligent adversary may behave and where the decision-making process of the\nadversary is unknown, and is elicited by analyzing the adversary's decision\nproblem using priors on his utility function and beliefs. The motivation of\nthis research was to develop a computational algorithm that can be applied\nacross a broad range of ARA models; to the best of our knowledge, no such\nalgorithm currently exists. Using a two-person sequential model, we\nincrementally increase the size of the model and develop a simulation-based\napproximation of the true optimum where an exact solution is computationally\nimpractical. In particular, we begin with a relatively large decision space by\nconsidering a theoretically continuous space that must be discretized. Then, we\nincrementally increase the number of strategic objectives which causes the\ndecision space to grow exponentially. The problem is exacerbated by the\npresence of an intelligent adversary who also must solve an exponentially large\ndecision problem according to some unknown decision-making process.\nNevertheless, using a stylized example that can be solved analytically we show\nthat our algorithm not only solves large ARA models quickly but also accurately\nselects to the true optimal solution. Furthermore, the algorithm is\nsufficiently general that it can be applied to any ARA model with a large, yet\nfinite, decision space.",

Although (A)\nis robust, it is unfavorable with respect to accuracy and data assimilation.\n(B) requires a prior, it is generally brittle and posterior estimations can be\nslow. Although (C) leads to the identification of an optimal prior, its\napproximation suffers from the curse of dimensionality and the notion of risk\nis one that is averaged with respect to the distribution of the data. We\nintroduce a 4th kind which is a hybrid between (A), (B), (C), and hypothesis\ntesting. It can be summarized as, after observing a sample $x$, (1) defining a\nlikelihood region through the relative likelihood and (2) playing a minmax game\nin that region to define optimal estimators and their risk. The resulting\nmethod has several desirable properties (a) an optimal prior is identified\nafter measuring the data, and the notion of risk is a posterior one, (b) the\ndetermination of the optimal estimate and its risk can be reduced to computing\nthe minimum enclosing ball of the image of the likelihood region under the\nquantity of interest map (which is fast and not subject to the curse of\ndimensionality). The method is characterized by a parameter in $ [0,1]$ acting\nas an assumed lower bound on the rarity of the observed data (the relative\nlikelihood). When that parameter is near $1$, the method produces a posterior\ndistribution concentrated around a maximum likelihood estimate with tight but\nlow confidence UQ estimates. When that parameter is near $0$, the method\nproduces a maximal risk posterior distribution with high confidence UQ\nestimates. In addition to navigating the accuracy-uncertainty tradeoff, the\nproposed method addresses the brittleness of Bayesian inference by navigating\nthe robustness-accuracy tradeoff associated with data assimilation.",

        "abstract": "In many areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we are interested in helping people make better decisions. This help can result in two advantages. First, computers can process large amounts of data and perform quick calculations, leading to better decisions. Second, if a user does not have to think about some decisions, they have more time to focus on other things they find important. Since users\u2019 preferences are private, in order to make intelligent decisions, we need to elicit an accurate model of the users\u2019 preferences for different outcomes. We are specifically interested in outcomes involving a degree of risk or uncertainty. A common goal in AI preference elicitation is minimizing regret, or loss of utility. We are often interested in minimax regret, or minimizing the worst-case regret. This thesis examines three important aspects of preference elicitation and minimax regret. First, the standard elicitation process in AI assumes users\u2019 preferences follow the axioms of Expected Utility Theory (EUT). However, there is strong evidence from psychology that people may systematically deviate from EUT. Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is an alternative model to expected utility theory which has been shown empirically to better explain humans\u2019 decision-making in risky settings. We show that the standard elicitation process can be incompatible with CPT. We develop a new elicitation process that is compatible with both CPT and minimax regret. Second, since minimax regret focuses on the worst-case regret, minimax regret is often an overly cautious estimate of the actual regret. As a result, using minimax regret can often create an unnecessarily long elicitation process. We create a new measure of regret that can be a more accurate estimate of the actual regret. Our measurement of regret is especially well suited for eliciting preferences from multiple users. Finally, we examine issues of multiattribute preferences. Multiattribute preferences provide a natural way for people to reason about preferences. Unfortunately, in the worstcase, the complexity of a user\u2019s preferences grows exponentially with respect to the number of attributes. Several models have been proposed to help create compact representations of multiattribute preferences. We compare both the worst-case and average-case relative compactness.",

Using established survey methodology we sought to investigate the perceptions and terms of application of the precautionary principle in this important subset of individuals. A total of 240 surveys were sent out to seven departments or agencies in the Canadian government. The overall survey response rate was 26.6%, and our findings need to be interpreted in the context of possible responder bias. Of respondents, the overwhelming majority perceived the precautionary principle and the management of risk as complementary, and endorsed a role for the precautionary principle as a general guideline for all risk management decisions. However, 25% of respondents responded that the lack of clarity of the definition of the principle was a limitation to its effective use. The majority of respondents viewed their own level of understanding of the precautionary principle as moderate. Risk managers appeared to favor an interpretation of the precautionary principle that was based on the seriousness and irreversibility of the threat of damage, and did not endorse as strongly the need for cost effectiveness in the measures taken as a precaution against such threats. In contrast with its perceived role as a general guideline, the application of the precautionary principle by respondents was highly variable, with >60% of respondents reporting using the precautionary principle in one\u2010quarter or less of all risk management decisions. Several factors influenced whether the precautionary principle was applied with the perceived seriousness of the threat being considered the most influential factor. The overwhelming majority of risk managers felt that \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d was the level of evidence required for precautionary action to be instituted against a serious negative event. Overall, the majority of respondents viewed the precautionary principle as having a significant and positive impact on risk management decisions. Importantly, respondents endorsed a net result of more good than harm to society when the precautionary principle was applied to the management of risk.",

We do not find clear evidence for cross-temperance. Our results indicate that longevity and wealth are considered to be substitutes for gains, but not for losses. Second, univariate (higher order) risk preferences are comparable for longevity and wealth, although somewhat closer to linearity for wealth.

The lack of\nempirical data and complex causal and outcome relationships make it difficult\nto estimate the degree to which certain risk types are exposed. Traditional\nrisk models are based on classical set theory. In comparison, fuzzy logic\nmodels are built on fuzzy set theory and are useful for analyzing risks with\ninsufficient knowledge or inaccurate data. Fuzzy logic systems help to make\nlarge-scale risk management frameworks more simple. For risks that do not have\nan appropriate probability model, a fuzzy logic system can help model the cause\nand effect relationships, assess the level of risk exposure, rank key risks in\na consistent way, and consider available data and experts'opinions. Besides, in\nfuzzy logic systems, some rules explicitly explain the connection, dependence,\nand relationships between model factors. This can help identify risk mitigation\nsolutions. Resources can be used to mitigate risks with very high levels of\nexposure and relatively low hedging costs. Fuzzy set and fuzzy logic models can\nbe used with Bayesian and other types of method recognition and decision\nmodels, including artificial neural networks and decision tree models. These\ndeveloped models have the potential to solve difficult risk assessment\nproblems.

The world economy has also not been spared from crisis, as in September 2008 it teetered on the verge of economic collapse following the cascading failures of mortgage and financial markets in the United States and elsewhere. More recently, in March 2011 the world witnessed in horror as Japan struggled to deal with the triple calamity of a massive earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear accident. These events remind us that as individuals, organizations, communities, and nations we are highly vulnerable to catastrophic events. This vulnerability arises not just because of the scale or unpredictability of these disasters, but because of the complex manner in which people and institutions respond to risk.

        "abstract": "Requirements elicitation consists in collecting information about the requirements and the environment of a systemto-be. It usually involves business analysts who are eliciting information, and stakeholders who are providing information. This paper investigates how the commitment of stakeholders to a RE project influences the results of elicitation. We suggest a way to measure the commitment of stakeholders during RE, and propose the so-called \"commitment matrix\", which shows what analysts can expect from stakeholders who are more, as opposed to those who are less committed. The matrix builds on a survey of 87 stakeholders. Our results suggest that commitment somehow affects the information provided by stakeholders, and that it is therefore a relevant criterion to account for when selecting stakeholders to be involved in elicitation.",

        "abstract": "The premise of this article is that risk to a system, as well as its vulnerability and resilience, can be understood, defined, and quantified most effectively through a systems\u2010based philosophical and methodological approach, and by recognizing the central role of the system states in this process. A universally agreed\u2010upon definition of risk has been difficult to develop; one reason is that the concept is multidimensional and nuanced. It requires an understanding that risk to a system is inherently and fundamentally a function of the initiating event, the states of the system and of its environment, and the time frame. In defining risk, this article posits that: (a) the\u2002performance capabilities\u2002of a system are a function of its state vector; (b) a system's\u2002vulnerability\u2002and\u2002resilience vectors\u2002are each a function of the input (e.g., initiating event), its time of occurrence, and the states of the system; (c) the\u2002consequences\u2002are a function of the specificity and time of the event, the vector of the states, the vulnerability, and the resilience of the system; (d) the\u2002states\u2002of a system are time\u2010dependent and commonly fraught with variability uncertainties and knowledge uncertainties; and (e)\u2002risk\u2002is a measure of the probability and severity of consequences. The above implies that modeling must evaluate consequences for each risk scenario as functions of the threat (initiating event), the vulnerability and resilience of the system, and the time of the event. This fundamentally complex modeling and analysis process cannot be performed correctly and effectively without relying on the states of the system being studied.",

We construct a number of individual health and nutritional indexes, including the Healthy Eating Index based on the USDA guidelines. We elicit preferences for risk using variants of the Holt and Laury (2002) paired lotteries test. Conditional on individual health habits and life style variables, we estimate the risk preferences for each subject, using Maximum Likelihood estimation. We observe that risk preferences significantly differ for subjects with different health habits and found some evidence of risk aversion. In particular, while smokers do not appear to be significantly more risk seeking, subjects with high scores of the Healthy Eating Index are characterized by higher degree of risk aversion.",

In this paper, we demonstrate a broadly applicable, novel and structured elicitation approach to identify important direct risk factors. This new approach combines expert calibration and fuzzy based mathematics to capture and aggregate subjective expert estimates of the likelihood that a set of direct risk factors will cause management failure. A specific case study is used to demonstrate the approach; however, the described methods are widely applicable in risk analysis. For the case study, the management target was to retain all species that characterise a set of natural biological elements. The analysis was bounded by the spatial distribution of the biological elements under consideration and a 20-year time frame. Fourteen biological elements were expected to be at risk. Eleven important direct risk factors were identified that related to surrounding land use practices, climate change, problem species (e.g., feral predators), fire and hydrological change. In terms of their overall influence, the two most important risk factors were salinisation and a lack of water which together pose a considerable threat to the survival of nine biological elements. The described approach successfully overcame two concerns arising from previous risk analysis work: (1) the lack of an intuitive, yet comprehensive scoring method enabling the detection and clarification of expert agreement and associated levels of uncertainty; and (2) the ease with which results can be interpreted and communicated while preserving a rich level of detail essential for informed decision making.",

Typically these parameters are elicited by presenting decision makers with a series of static choices between alternatives, gambles or delayed payments. The proposed method dynamically (i.e., adaptively) designs such choices to optimize the information provided by each choice, while leveraging the distribution of the parameters across decision makers (heterogeneity) and capturing response error. We explore the convergence and the validity of our approach using simulations. The simulations suggest that the proposed method recovers true parameter values well under various circumstances. We then use an online experiment to compare our approach to a standard one used in the literature that requires comparable task completion time. We assess predictive accuracy in an out-ofsample task and completion time for both methods. For risk preferences, our results indicate that the proposed method predicts subjects' willingness to pay for a set of out-of-sample gambles significantly more accurately, while taking respondents about the same time to complete. For time preferences, both methods predict out-of-sample preferences equally well while the proposed method takes significantly less completion time. For risk and for time preferences, average completion time for our approach is approximately three minutes. Finally, we briefly review three applications that used the proposed methodology with various populations, and discuss the potential benefits of the proposed methodology for research and practice.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the growing interest in sound forecast evaluation techniques with an emphasis on distribution tails rather than average behaviour, we investigate a fundamental question arising in this context: Can statistical features of distribution tails be elicitable, i.e. be the unique minimizer of an expected score? We demonstrate that expected scores are not suitable to distinguish genuine tail properties in a very strong sense. Specifically, we introduce the class of max-functionals, which contains key characteristics from extreme value theory, for instance the extreme value index. We show that its members fail to be elicitable and that their elicitation complexity is in fact infinite under mild regularity assumptions. Further we prove that, even if the information of a max-functional is reported via the entire distribution function, a proper scoring rule cannot separate maxfunctional values. These findings highlight the caution needed in forecast evaluation and statistical inference if relevant information is encoded by such functionals.

        "abstract": "Many people do not possess the necessary savings to deal with unexpected financial events. People's biases play a significant role in their ability to forecast future financial shocks: they are typically overoptimistic, present-oriented, and generally underestimate future expenses. The purpose of this study is to investigate how varying risk information influences people's financial awareness, in order to reduce the chance of a financial downfall. Specifically, we contribute to the literature by exploring the concept of 'nudging' and its value for behavioural changes in personal financial management. While of great practical importance, the role of nudging in behavioural financial forecasting research is scarce. Additionally, the study steers away from the standard default choice architecture nudge, and adds originality by focusing on eliciting implementation intentions and precommitment strategies as types of nudges. Our experimental scenarios examined how people change their financial projections in response to nudges in the form of new information on relevant risks. Participants were asked to forecast future expenses and future savings. They then received information on potential events identified as high-risk, low-risk or no-risk. We investigated whether they adjusted their predictions in response to various risk scenarios or not and how such potential adjustments were affected by the information given. Our findings suggest that the provision of risk information alters financial forecasting behaviour. Notably, we found an adjustment effect even in the no-risk category, suggesting that governments and institutions concerned with financial behaviour can increase financial awareness merely by increasing salience about possible financial risks. Another practical implication relates to splitting savings into different categories, and by using different wordings: A financial advisory institution can help people in their financial behaviour by focusing on 'targets', and by encouraging (nudging) people to make breakdown forecasts rather than general ones.",

This problem, referred to here as risk apportionment, arises in various venues, including: (i) public health management, (ii) government programs for compensating injured individuals, and (iii) litigation. Two methods have been described in the risk analysis and epidemiology literature for allocating total risk among individual risk factors. One method uses weights to allocate interactions among the individual risk factors. The other method is based on risk accounting axioms and finding an optimal and unique allocation that satisfies the axioms using a procedure borrowed from game theory. Where relative risk or attributable risk is the risk measure, we find that the game\u2010theory\u2010determined allocation is the same as the allocation where risk factor interactions are apportioned to individual risk factors using equal weights. Therefore, the apportionment problem becomes one of selecting a meaningful set of weights for allocating interactions among the individual risk factors. Equal weights and weights proportional to the risks of the individual risk factors are discussed.",

In addition, this study tests the hypothesis that the effect of risk preference on choice depends upon its interaction with risk perceptions. I elicit three distinct measures of risk preference: a standard real-money Holt and Laury measure, a hypothetical health-variant of the Holt and Laury measure, and a non-context-specific self-assessment measure. I also elicit information regarding risk perceptions (specifically, food safety). These data are combined with choice data focused on consumer preferences for raw oysters. Results indicate that, after controlling for key oyster attributes, perceived risk perception is highly significant. Additionally, the effect of risk preference is significant, and the effect depends on whether respondents held informative or non-informative risk perceptions. In a treatment that includes only named oyster varieties, I find that although respondents generally prefer named Atlantic coast oysters to named Gulf and Pacific coast oysters, those who hold non-informative risk perceptions are even less likely to choose Gulf and Pacific coast oysters as the magnitude of risk aversion increases. In another treatment that includes a generic \u201ccommodity\u201d Gulf coast oyster, I find that although named Gulf coast oysters are generally preferred to the commodity Gulf coast oyster, respondents with non-informative risk perceptions are significantly less likely to choose named Gulf coast oysters as the magnitude of risk aversion increases.",

The two empirical studies presented here show that the magnitude of this optimistic bias can be either negatively or positively related to the perceived frequency of the event, depending on whether people judge their own risk relative to that of an average peer (make comparative risk judgments) or judge their own and an average peer's risk separately (make absolute risk judgments). A new two-process model is presented to account for these results. The model combines a better-thanaverage heuristic with elements of the singular target-focused and singular-distributional models",

I find that subjects do exhibit consistent risk preferences. The aggregate measure of the subjects' risk parameter is stable across both tasks, the estimated numeric values of subjects' risk parameters are stable across tasks, and the ranking of subjects (most risk averse to least risk averse) is stable across both tasks.",

We found that people accepted a lower risk of death when success and failure probabilities were framed as frequencies type \"Y deaths out of 1,000\" rather than as frequencies type \"X deaths out of 100\" and hence the utilities for health outcomes were higher when the denominator was 1000 than when it was 100. This framing effect, known as Ratio Bias, may have important consequences in resource allocation decisions.",

Using an analytical model of abatement, we show how aversion to model uncertainty influences the optimal level of mitigation. We disentangle the role of preferences from the structure of model uncertainty, which we define by means of a simple measure of disagreement across models. With data from an expert elicitation about climate change catastrophes, we quantify the relative importance of these two effects and calibrate a numerical integrated assessment model of climate change. The results indicate that the structure of model uncertainty, and specifically how model disagreement varies in abatement, is the key driver of optimal abatement and that model uncertainty warrants a higher level of climate change mitigation.

Three innovative methods are also considered: influence modeling based on environmental scans; simple elicitation using extinction scenarios as anchors; and computationally intensive possible\u2010worlds modeling. Evaluation criteria include: level of effort required by the probability assessors; level of effort needed to implement the method; ability of each method to model the human extinction event; ability to incorporate scientific estimates of contributory events; transparency of the inputs and outputs; acceptability to the academic community (e.g., with respect to intellectual soundness, familiarity, verisimilitude); credibility and utility of the outputs of the method to the policy community; difficulty of communicating the method's processes and outputs to nonexperts; and accuracy in other contexts.

Our results suggest that behavioral characteristics such as intolerance of risk, curiosity, and trust can be used to predict individual ability to identify phishing interfaces.",

        "abstract": "In probabilistic risk assessment, attention is often focused on the expected value of a risk metric. The sensitivity of this expectation to changes in the parameters of the distribution characterizing uncertainty in the inputs becomes of interest. Approaches based on differentiation encounter limitations when (i) distributional parameters are expressed in different units or (ii) the analyst wishes to transfer sensitivity insights from individual parameters to parameter groups, when alternating between different levels of a probabilistic safety assessment model. Moreover, the analyst may also wish to examine the effect of assuming independence among inputs. This work proposes an approach based on the differential importance measure, which solves these issues. Estimation aspects are discussed in detail, in particular the problem of obtaining all sensitivity measures from a single Monte Carlo sample, thus avoiding potentially costly model runs. The approach is illustrated through an analytical example, highlighting how it can be used to assess the impact of removing the independence assumption. An application to the probabilistic risk assessment model of the Advanced Test Reactor large loss of coolant accident sequence concludes the work.",

Eliciting incomplete preferences using holistic pair-wise judgments is convenient for the decision maker, but selecting the best pair-wise comparison is difficult. We propose a framework for comparing holistic preference elicitation questions based on their expected information gain, and introduce a procedure for approximating the optimal question. We extend the basic approach to generate reference alternatives that differ on only a few attributes, and to determine when further preference information is unlikely to reduce decision uncertainty. We present results from computational experiments that assess the performance of the procedure and assess the impact of limiting the number of attributes on which the reference alternatives differ. The tests show that the proposed method performs well, and when implemented in a decision support system it may substantially improve on-line elicitation using pair-wise comparisons.",

Despite a wealth of experimental contributions on risk preferences, stemming from a variety of elicitation tasks, the external validity of standard measures of risk is questionable. In this study we focus on a risk task -the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) -which is highly successful in predicting health-related risk behaviors such as alcohol use, drug use, smoking, unprotected sex, driving without a seatbelt, and stealing. The BART is not commonly used by economic scholars because of concerns that participants may not adequately comprehend uncertainty associated with the task and because of the resulting difficulty in relating participants' choices to standard risk models. To answer these concerns and build on associations with real world risk, we designed a modified BART, which we will refer to as the Balloon Economic Risk Protocol (BERP). In this protocol, participants observe the distribution of pop points prior to the task to create a more consistent knowledge base. We then use a belief elicitation technique to produce a user-generated prior distribution of balloon pops. Using these measures, we compare participants' behavior to the expected-value optimum to provide a link to standard models of risk. In accordance with past economic literature, we found that participants' BERP-generated risk preferences revealed mild risk aversion on average, and correlated with a self-report questionnaire on drinking, drug use, and smoking behavior.",

Among all real-valued mappings on a general set of distributions, left quantiles are the only ones satisfying left-ordinal covariance, meaning that they commute with increasing left-continuous transforms; the case of right quantiles is analogous. Other convenient properties of quantiles, monotonicity in particular, follow from this axiom. In banking and insurance, quantiles are known as Value-at-Risk (VaR), a standard regulatory risk measure. Thus, we obtain an axiomatization of VaR with only one axiom among law-based risk measures. We further show that VaR can be alternatively characterized via the axiom of locality, plus four standard axioms relevant in financial risk management, namely, monotonicity, normalization, cash additivity, and semicontinuit",

Specificity might be improved by OMB: (1) communicating and enforcing distributional impacts as more central to the process, (2) identifying default types of descriptive distributional statistics, (3) identifying whether legislation has created a constraint to not harm a subgroup, and (4) requesting a distributional sensitivity test of the net benefits along with a standard benefit\u2010cost analysis.

The criteria employed were (1) sample respondent capability in answering questions, (2) means and corresponding risk attitudes classification and (3) distribution of risk attitudes. According to the first criterion, the results showed PWD technique is the best one. While there are no differences among the three direct techniques on the basis of the second criterion. Also, the findings indicate that respondent education and age, family education, level of hypothetical income and a greater explanation by other people during interview have an influence on respondent capability in answering questions.

We present results of a contingent valuation (CV) study carried out in Austria in two different periods (fall 2004 and winter 2005). The comparison of WTP results between the two waves allows the identification whether the immediate occurrence of avalanches and their attendant deathly accidents affect individual risk evaluations. Surprisingly, individuals state a lower WTP in winter although avalanche accidents are predominant at that time. Personal responsibility of risk exposure and its associated voluntariness are main reasons for the decrease in WTP over time. Preferences for alternative protective measures (e.g. against car accidents or food poisoning) also lead to a decrease of WTP while a higher risk perception and personal experience with avalanches show a positive influence. We conclude that the change in WTP across seasons is not arbitrary but can be explained by specific risk characteristics. It follows that WTP is more robust as previously assumed and therefore represents a proper measure for the elicitation of individual risk reduction preferences.D81, J17, Q51",

We focus on situations where correlated uncertainties are discrete, and extend the concept of the copula\u2010based approach for modeling correlated continuous uncertainties to the representation of correlated discrete uncertainties. This approach reduces the required number of probability assessments significantly compared to approaches requiring direct estimates of conditional probabilities. It also allows the use of multiple dependence measures, including product moment correlation, rank order correlation and tail dependence, and parametric families of copulas such as normal copulas, t\u2010copulas, and Archimedean copulas. This approach can be extended to model the dependence between discrete and continuous uncertainties in the same event tree.",

        "abstract": "This article traces the development of uncertainty analysis through three generations punctuated by large methodology investments in the nuclear sector. Driven by a very high perceived legitimation burden, these investments aimed at strengthening the scientific basis of uncertainty quantification. The first generation building off the Reactor Safety Study introduced structured expert judgment in uncertainty propagation and distinguished variability and uncertainty. The second generation emerged in modeling the physical processes inside the reactor containment building after breach of the reactor vessel. Operational definitions and expert judgment for uncertainty quantification were elaborated. The third generation developed in modeling the consequences of release of radioactivity and transport through the biosphere. Expert performance assessment, dependence elicitation and probabilistic inversion are among the hallmarks. Third generation methods may be profitably employed in current Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) of climate change. Possible applications of dependence modeling and probabilistic inversion are sketched. It is unlikely that these methods will be fully adequate for quantitative uncertainty analyses of the impacts of climate change, and a penultimate section looks ahead to fourth generation methods.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive psychology is best known, to many environmental economists, through the filter of acrimonious debates over the validity of contingent valuation methods (CVM). Psychologists' views on CVM reflect concerns that are deeply rooted in their profession's history and theories. Although psychologists have participated in some CVM studies, their roles have rarely allowed them to present a comprehensive design philosophy, illustrated in actual studies. This chapter sets psychologists' critiques and alternatives within a general cognitive perspective on value elicitation, including stated preferences for environmental goods. It begins with a historical review, organized around two converging streams of psychological research. One stream leads from psychophysics to attitude research. The second leads from decision theory to decision analysis and behavioral decision research. The next section reports some environmental valuation studies arising from each tradition. These studies do not directly monetize environmental goods. However, they can still directly inform policies that do not require monetization and indirectly inform policies that do, by shaping studies with that ambition. The following section considers the role of cognitive studies in helping investigators to know what issues matter to people and present them comprehensibly. The concluding section of the chapter presents a cognitive approach to stated preference methods for environmental values -one that could be developed most fully in collaboration with economists. It is built around a cognitive task analysis of the four main elements in any evaluation process: (a) specifying the valuation question, (b) understanding its terms, (c) articulating a value for that specific question (from more general basic values), and (d) expressing that value in a public form.",

Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part O: Journal of Risk and Reliability. Abstract Assessing the likelihood of future events is core to technical risk management at Scottish Power Generation (SPG). Events can include failures resulting in unavailability of key assets, or incidents impacting staff safety or the environment. Eliciting probabilities from engineers to quantify the likelihood of future, uncertain events is challenging given the diversity of assets across the multiple, heterogeneous power plants operated by SPG. Such probability assessments inform investment decisions intended to manage technical risks and support regulatory compliance. Through interviews with engineers we reveal the opportunities for heuristics and bias that explain some of the historical disparities in assessments intuitively evident to risk managers. We propose better ways of obtaining judgemental probability assessments based on a study involving engineers and a control group of post-experience students. We find that the choice of scale descriptors impacts the probability values of defined events as judged by engineers. Consequently we suggest changes to the risk management system, including new design features to better frame and capture probability assessments. As a consequence of our study, the technical risk management process is being enhanced in a number of ways including the creation of a single organisational-wide framework, clearer guidelines, and better knowledge management.",
