In the case of a highly reliable system, such\nas the electricity grid, the amount of relevant data is often exceedingly\nlimited, but the impact of estimation errors may be very large. This paper\npresents a robust nonparametric Bayesian method to infer possible underlying\ndistributions. The method obtains rigorous error bounds even for small samples\ntaken from ill-behaved distributions. The approach taken has a natural\ninterpretation in terms of the intervals between ordered observations, where\nallocation of probability mass across intervals is well-specified, but the\nlocation of that mass within each interval is unconstrained. This formulation\ngives rise to a straightforward computational resampling method: Bayesian\nInterval Sampling. In a comparison with common alternative approaches, it is\nshown to satisfy strict error bounds even for ill-behaved distributions.Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures; supplementary information provided.

        "abstract": "Validation of psychological tests has not yet been adequately conceptualized, as the APA Committee on Psychological Tests learned when it undertook (1950-54) to specify what qualities should be investigated before a test is published. In order to make coherent recommendations the Committee found it necessary to distinguish four types of validity, established by different types of research and requiring different interpretation. The chief innovation in the Committee's report was the term construct validity.[2] This idea was first formulated by a subcommittee (Meehl and R. C. Challman) studying how proposed recommendations would apply to projective techniques, and later modified and clarified by the entire Committee (Bordin, Challman, Conrad, Humphreys, Super, and the present writers). The statements agreed upon by the Committee (and by committees of two other associations) were published in the Technical Recommendations (59). The present interpretation of construct validity is not \"official\" and deals with some areas where the Committee would probably not be unanimous. The present writers are solely responsible for this attempt to explain the concept and elaborate its implications.",

In particular, disruptions to the operation of container port activity can be detrimental for international trade and commerce. Risk assessment should anticipate the impact of port operation disruptions with consideration of how priorities change due to uncertain scenarios and guide investments that are effective and feasible for implementation. Priorities for protective measures and continuity of operations planning must consider the economic impact of such disruptions across a variety of scenarios. This article introduces new performance metrics to characterize resiliency in interdependency modeling and also integrates scenario\u2010based methods to measure economic sensitivity to sudden\u2010onset disruptions. The methods will be demonstrated on a U.S. port responsible for handling $36.1 billion of cargo annually. The methods will be useful to port management, private industry supply chain planning, and transportation infrastructure management.",

        "abstract": "Multi-criteria decision-making is a daily process in everyday life, in which different alternatives are evaluated over a set of conflicting criteria. Decision-making is becoming increasingly complex, and the apparition of uncertainty and vagueness is inevitable, especially when related to sustainability issues. To model such lack of information, decision makers often use linguistic information to express their opinions, closer to their way of thinking, giving place to linguistic decision-making. However, the participation of multiple experts usually involves disagreements within the group, leading to unreliable solutions. To assist in decision-making and reduce such complexities, A grouP decisiOn fuzzy TOoL in support of cLimate change pOlicy making (APOLLO), a fuzzy decision support system, is introduced to deal with such problems in climate change and policy. The tool implements a framework for group decision-making, using 2-tuple Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), coupled with a new consensus measuring model to increase robustness of selected solutions. The operation of the software tool is showcased in a real case carried out in Austria, where stakeholders were asked to assess the risks embedded in pathways for decarbonizing the country\u2019s iron and steel sector. Results indicate that a coherent strategy addressing funding and competition issues is necessary, with experts displaying a consensus level of 85% in that these risks are the most threatening for the transition.",

Methods: Twenty four children who had Autism and who were not taking any medications and Twenty three age and sex matched controls (Children) were participated in this study . PBF and respiration signals as well as HRV signal derived from Electrocardiogram (ECG) were measured during supine and standing positions. Autopower, cross power and coherence spectra were produced to investigate the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in both groups. Results: The results clearly indicate that in children with Autism, the coherence values are less than in control group in both low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands at coherence spectra between HRV and PBF as well as HRV and respiration in both supine and standing position. Also, the ratio of amplitude at nearly frequency of 0.",

The fact that VaR is not coherent has motivated the industry to explore alternative risk measures like expected shortfall. The first objective of this paper is to propose statistical methods for estimating multiple-period expected shortfall under GARCH models. In addition to the expected shortfall, we investigate a new tool called median shortfall to measure risk. The second objective of this paper is to develop backtesting methods for assessing the performance of expected shortfall and median shortfall estimators from statistical and financial perspectives. By applying our expected shortfall estimators and other existing approaches to seven international markets, we demonstrate the superiority of our methods with respect to statistical and practical evaluations. Our expected shortfall estimators likely provide an unbiased reference for setting the minimum capital required for safeguarding against expected loss.",

Dual representations of such risk measures are presented. These are then used to obtain the main results of this paper on time consistency; namely, an equivalent recursive formulation of multivariate scalar risk measures to multiportfolio time consistency. We are motivated to study time consistency of multivariate scalar risk measures as the superhedging risk measure in markets with transaction costs (with a single eligible asset) (Jouini and Kallal (1995), Roux and Zastawniak (2016), Loehne and Rudloff (2014)) does not satisfy the usual scalar concept of time consistency. In fact, as demonstrated in (Feinstein and Rudloff (2021)), scalar risk measures with the same scalarization weight at all times would not be time consistent in general. The deduced recursive relation for the scalarizations of multiportfolio time consistent set-valued risk measures provided in this paper requires consideration of the entire family of scalarizations. In this way we develop a direct notion of a \"moving scalarization\" for scalar time consistency that corroborates recent research on scalarizations of dynamic multi-objective problems (Karnam, Ma, and Zhang (2017), Kovacova and Rudloff (2021)).",

To develop this idea, we first define the terms emotion, emotion regulation, and mental health. We then chart the development of emotion regulation and describe its role in various facets of normal functioning. Next, we consider what happens when emotion becomes dysregulated in a major depressive episode. We suggest that an emotion regulatory perspective integrates diverse theoretical views of depression and has implications for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of depression. We conclude by speculating about the role of emotion regulation in the broader context of public mental health.",

        "abstract": "ObjectivesThe Early Development Instrument (EDI) is a valid and reliable population-level tool measuring child developmental vulnerability in Kindergarten. The objective of this study was to derive and validate new EDI-based development \u201ccumulative vulnerability\u201d risk indicators using a cumulative risk index approach (Rutter, 1979). \nApproachThe EDI has two main outcome measures: individual domain scores and vulnerability (scoring below a 10% cutpoint). To account for more complexity, we derived two new \u201ccumulative vulnerability\u201d measures. The Mean EDI Domain Score (MEDS) is the mean of the domain scores, and the Total EDI Vulnerability Index (TEVI) is an ordinal summative measure using domain vulnerability indicators. In Study I, we examined the relationship of the MEDS and TEVI measures with neighbourhood-level SES. In Study II, we examined the predictive/explanatory power of the MEDS and TEVI measures with Grade 3 provincial assessments in Ontario, Canada. \nResultsStudy I used EDI Kindergarten data from twelve provincial and territorial data collections between 2008 and 2013 in Canada (316,015 children) aggregated to 2,038 customized neighbourhoods. The two new cumulative vulnerability measures worked as expected, with positive association between MEDS and neighbourhood SES (r=0.58), and a negative association between TEVI and neighbourhood SES (r=-0.57). Study II used data from 61,039 Kindergarten children matched between the EDI and Grade 3 EQAO datasets. The predictive/explanatory power of Mean EDI Domain Scores (MEDS; R2=0.11 to 0.15) was twice that of new ordinal summative measure (TEVI; R2=0.06 to 0.08). Interestingly, the predictive power of the TEVI was similar to that of the composite EDI outcome measure, overall vulnerability (vulnerable on one or more domains). \nConclusionThe MEDS and TEVI work as expected and can be used for research and reporting purposes. More specifically, the TEVI can also be used as a severity metric evaluating the impact of multiple developmental vulnerabilities. It is recommended that further research be conducted to validate the measures with other datasets.",

        "abstract": "Conventional means of diagnosiing and assessing the progression of osteoporosis, including radiographic absorptiometry and quantitative CT, are directly or indirectly dependent upon bone density. This is, how ever, not always a reliable indicator of fracture risk. Changes in the trabecular structure and bone mineral content (BMC) are thought to provide a better indication of the change of spontaneous fractures occurring. Coherent-scatter CT (CSCT) is a technique which produces images based on the low angle (0 - 10 degrees) x-ray diffraction properties of tissue. Diffraction patterns from an object are acquired using first-generation CT geometry with a diagnostic x-ray image intensifier based system. These patterns are used to reconstruct a series of maps of the angle dependent coherent scatter cross section in a tomographic slice which are dependent upon the molecular structure of the scatterer. Hydroxyapatite has a very different cross section to that of soft tissue, and the CSCT method may, therefore, form the basis for a more direct measure of BMC. Our original CSCT images suffered from a 'cupping' artifact, resulting in increased intensities for pixels at the periphery of the object. This artifact, which is due to self-attenuation of scattered x rays, caused a systematic error of up to 20% in cross-sections measured from a CT image. This effect has been removed by monitoring the transmitted intensity using a photodiode mounted on the primary beam stop, and normalizing the scatter intensity to that of the transmitted beam for each projection. Images reconstructed from data normalized in this way do not exhibit observable attenuation artifacts. Elimination of this artifact enables the determination of accurate quantitative measures of BMC at each pixel in a tomograph.",

        "abstract": "AbstractNeurodevelopmental abnormalities in neural connectivity have been long implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia (SCZ); however, it remains unclear whether these neural connectivity patterns are associated with genetic risk for SCZ in unaffected individuals (i.e., an absence of clinical features of SCZ or a family history of SCZ). We examine whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for SCZ are associated with functional neural connectivity in adolescents and young adults without SCZ, whether this association is moderated by sex and age, and if similar associations are observed for genetically related neuropsychiatric PRS. One-thousand four-hundred twenty-six offspring from 913 families, unaffected with SCZ, were drawn from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) prospective cohort (median age at first interview = 15.6 (12\u201326), 51.6% female, 98.1% European American, 41% with a family history of alcohol dependence). Participants were followed longitudinally with resting-state EEG connectivity (i.e., coherence) assessed every two years. Higher SCZ PRS were associated with elevated theta (3\u20137 Hz) and alpha (7\u201312 Hz) EEG coherence. Associations differed by sex and age; the most robust associations were observed between PRS and parietal-occipital, central-parietal, and frontal-parietal alpha coherence among males between ages 15\u201319 (B: 0.15\u20130.21, p < 10\u20134). Significant associations among EEG coherence and Bipolar and Depression PRS were observed, but differed from SCZ PRS in terms of sex, age, and topography. Findings reveal that polygenic risk for SCZ is robustly associated with increased functional neural connectivity among young adults without a SCZ diagnosis. Striking differences were observed between men and women throughout development, mapping onto key periods of risk for the onset of psychotic illness and underlining the critical importance of examining sex differences in associations with neuropsychiatric PRS across development.",

SDR combines Expected Shortfall (ES) and Shortfall Deviation (SD), which we also introduce, contemplating two fundamental pillars of the risk concept, the probability of adverse events and the variability of an expectation, and considers extreme results. We demonstrate that SD is a generalized deviation measure, whereas SDR is a coherent risk measure. We achieve the dual representation of SDR, and we discuss issues such as its representation by a weighted ES, acceptance sets, convexity, continuity and the relationship with stochastic dominance. Illustrations with real and simulated data allow us to conclude that SDR offers greater protection in risk measurement compared with VaR and ES, especially in times of significant turbulence in riskier scenarios.",

The probability of negative return under the condition that collaterals\nare liquidated in a falling market is used to measure the risk associated with\nmargin loans, and a recursive algorithm is proposed to calculate this\nprobability under a Markov chain model. The optimal maintenance margin ratio\ncan be given under the constraint of the proposed risk measurement for a\nspecified amount of initial margin. An example of such a margin system is\nconstructed and applied to $26,800$ margin loans of 134 stocks traded on the\nShanghai Stock Exchange. The empirical results indicate that the proposed\nmethod is an operational method for brokers to set margin system with a clearly\nspecified target of risk control.",

When the spin-lattice interaction is\nvaried, the coherence always increases irrespective of the relation between its\ndirection and the measurement basis. Similar analysis of quantum coherence\nbased on the variation of the external inhomogenous magnetic field is also\ncarried out, where we find that the coherence decreases when the direction of\nthe measurement basis is the same as that of the external field.",

        "abstract": "It was a search for understanding the nature and origins of schizophrenia that brought Norman Garmezy to the study of children at risk for psychopathology, a pursuit that eventually led to the Project Competence studies of competence, adversity, and resilience (Garmezy, 1973). During the 1940s and 1950s, Garmezy developed an interest in the significance of competence in the history and prognosis of patients with serious mental disorders, with a particular focus on premorbid functioning in patients with schizophrenia (Garmezy & Rodnick, 1959). Eventually, the search for antecedents of psychopathology led Garmezy and others to study children of mentally ill parents because of their elevated risk of developing disorders. After his move to the University of Minnesota in 1961, Garmezy began to focus his work on children, and subsequently played a leading role in an international consortium of investigators who adopted the risk strategy for uncovering clues to the etiology and possible prevention or treatment of serious mental disorders (Watt, Anthony, Wynne, & Rolf, 1984). It was not long before Garmezy's interest in competence resurfaced. He became intrigued with observations that many children at risk for psychopathology were developing surprisingly well. By the early 1970s, he and his students turned their attention to the study of competence in children at risk due to parental mental illness and other risk factors, including poverty and stressful life experiences. At this time, Garmezy named his research program Project Competence.",

Based on what has been learned, the paper provides suggestions about how the performance of future VET interventions can be improved.

The sense of coherence (SoC) is deemed to be a personal resource capable of reducing the impact of job stressors and, consequently, the experience of job burnout. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between SoC and job burnout among speech and language therapists. A descriptive and cross-sectional analysis was carried out through an online self-reported questionnaire. A total of 217 Italian speech and language therapists were involved in the study. The Anova test, T-test and logistic regression were performed to study the association between SoC and job burnout. The Anova test showed that job tenure was not associated to job burnout. The T-test showed that speech and language therapists having a low SoC exhibited significantly higher emotional exhaustion, higher cynicism, and lower professional efficacy (t=-7.190 d.f.=215 p<.001) when compared to those having a high SoC. Finally, the odds ratio showed that low SoC was associated with high emotional exhaustion (OR=11.86; 95% CI=5.52-25.49; p<0.05), low SoC was associated with high cynicism (OR=4.41, CI=2.50-7.80; p<0.05), and low SoC was associated with low personal efficacy (OR=4.70; CI=2.59-8.52; p<0.05). Our results are in line with previous studies which showed that SoC is a fundamental personal resource which may activate workers' reaction to various stressors, thus reducing the experience of burnout.",

        "abstract": "Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE\u03bdNS) is a process in which neutrinos scatter on a nucleus which acts as a single particle. Though the total cross section is large by neutrino standards, CE\u03bdNS has long proven difficult to detect, since the deposited energy into the nucleus is \u223c keV. In 2017, the COHERENT collaboration announced the detection of CE\u03bdNS using a stopped-pion source with CsI detectors, followed up the detection of CE\u03bdNS using an Ar target. The detection of CE\u03bdNS has spawned a flurry of activities in high-energy physics, inspiring new constraints on beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, and new experimental methods. The CE\u03bdNS process has important implications for not only high-energy physics, but also astrophysics, nuclear physics, and beyond. This whitepaper discusses the scientific importance of CE\u03bdNS, highlighting how present experiments such as COHERENT are informing theory, and also how future experiments will provide a wealth of information across the aforementioned fields of physics.",

The copula function describes the dependence structure of a multivariate random variable. In this paper, it is used as a practical and flexible instrument to generate Monte Carlo scenarios of risk factor returns. These risk factors affect the value of a credit or market portfolio. In fact, many of the models commonly used assume a multinormal distribution of such risk factor returns (or log-returns). This hypothesis underestimates the probability that a catastrophic event, such as a simultaneous slump of equity prices or the joint default of several counterparties in a credit portfolio, might occur. This kind of event worries both risk managers and supervisors. Our goal is to show that the use of a copula function different from the Gaussian copula can model such extreme events effectively.",

The reason for this is that amplitudes suffer from the calibration\neffect (the same for coherent and incoherent averages) and thus effectively\nprovide lower accuracy measurements.

However, in literature we can fi nd many alternative dispersion and risk measures that can help us to identify the most suitable investment opportunity. In this work two new dispersion measures, fulfi lling the condition that \"more is better than less\" are proposed. Moreover, their distinct characteristics are analysed and empirically compared. In particular, starting from the defi nition of dispersion measures, we discuss the property of consistency with respect to additive shifts and we examine two dispersion measures that satisfy this property. Finally, we empirically compare the proposed dispersion measures with the standard deviation and the conditional value at risk on the US stock market. Moreover, within the empirical example the so called \"alarm\" is incorporated in order to predict potential fails of the market.",

We discuss and compare the properties of these different measures, and point out that the VaR is seriously flawed. We then discuss how QBRMs can be estimated, and discuss some of the many ways they might be applied to insurance risk problems. These applications are typically very complex, and this complexity means that the most appropriate estimation method will often be some form of stochastic simulation.",

By providing the reader a glimpse into the tradition of their various qualitative metasynthesis projects, these authors offer a finely nuanced examination of the tensions between comparison and integration, deconstruction and synthesis, and reporting and integration within the metasynthesis endeavor. In so doing, they account for many of the current confusions about representation and generalization within the products of these inquiries. Through understanding the bases of their unique angles of vision, the reader is invited to engage in their commitment to scholarly integrity and intellectual credibility in this emerging methodological challenge.",

        "abstract": "Scholars have begun to explore the role of modes of information processing and related audience characteristics in reactions to risky situations and risk information.( 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20)\u201cInformation processing\u201d concerns how people attend to and consider available information: systematic processors analyze messages and situations carefully, while heuristic processors skim and use cues (e.g., opinions of trusted reference groups) for quick judgments. This article uses scenarios about a semi\u2010hypothetical industrial facility, in particular risk comparisons being considered by its manager for inclusion in a talk to the community, to explore the impact of information processing. Information insufficiency, self\u2010assessed capacity to understand information, and information\u2010seeking propensities are tested for potential effects on information processing about industrial risks by people living near industry. As well as testing established models, this article explores the additional explanatory value of involvement, relevance, and ability (Earle et al., 1990) and objective knowledge. Both existing model variables and new ones have significant effects on information seeking and information processing in this case, and partly confirm earlier results. Trumbo( 17,18) found that heuristic processors saw lower risk and systematic processors higher risk from suspected cancer clusters. In this study, reporting knowledge about local industrial risks as insufficient for one's purposes and self\u2010reported avoidance of such information both raised ratings of the facility's risk and lowered ratings of its acceptability. Neither type of information processing significantly affected risk or acceptability judgments, but both increased risk ratings and heuristic processing had more effect than systematic processing. Positive ratings of risk comparisons' clarity and meaningfulness decreased risk and increased acceptability ratings, dominated other information variables in predictive power, and exceeded risk, benefit, and trust in contribution to acceptability judgments. Despite differences across studies in designs and variables, and the embryonic development of appropriate (self\u2010reported) measures for use in field surveys, these results confirm the potential value of further research in how information seeking and processing affect risk beliefs and reactions to risk communications.",

A.\nFisher proposed for inductive reasoning the use of the fiducial distribution, a\nparameter-space distribution of epistemological probability transferred\ndirectly from limiting relative frequencies rather than computed according to\nthe Bayes update rule. The proposal is developed as follows using the\nconfidence measure of a scalar parameter of interest. (With the restriction to\none-dimensional parameter space, a confidence measure is essentially a fiducial\nprobability distribution free of complications involving ancillary statistics.)\n  A betting game establishes a sense in which confidence measures are the only\nreliable inferential probability distributions. The equality between the\nprobabilities encoded in a confidence measure and the coverage rates of the\ncorresponding confidence intervals ensures that the measure's rule for\nassigning confidence levels to hypotheses is uniquely minimax in the game.\n  Although a confidence measure can be computed without any prior distribution,\nprevious knowledge can be incorporated into confidence-based reasoning. To\nadjust a p-value or confidence interval for prior information, the confidence\nmeasure from the observed data can be combined with one or more independent\nconfidence measures representing previous agent opinion. (The former confidence\nmeasure may correspond to a posterior distribution with frequentist matching of\ncoverage probabilities.) The representation of subjective knowledge in terms of\nconfidence measures rather than prior probability distributions preserves\napproximate frequentist validity.Comment: major revisio",

Various authors have studied and derived the asymptotic properties of the empirical estimator of SRM. We propose a kernel based estimator of SRM. We investigate the large sample properties of general L-statistics based on i.i.d and dependent observations and apply them to our estimator. We prove that it is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. We compare the finite sample performance of our proposed kernel estimator with that of several existing estimators for different SRMs using Monte Carlo simulation. We observe that our proposed kernel estimator outperforms all the estimators. Based on our simulation study we have estimated the exponential SRM of four future indices-that is Nikkei 225, Dax, FTSE 100, and Hang Seng. We also perform a backtesting exercise of SRM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract COVID-19 pandemic is inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and eventual death. Respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality in the elderly population with pre-existing medical conditions. This group is particularly vulnerable to infections due to a declined immune system, comorbidities, geriatric syndrome, and potentially inappropriate polypharmacy. These conditions make the elderly population more susceptible to the harmful effects of medications and the deleterious consequences of infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Chronic diseases among elderlies, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases, present a significant challenge for healthcare professionals. To comply with the clinical guidelines, the practitioner may prescribe a complex medication regimen that adds up to the burden of pre-existing treatment, potentially inducing adverse drug reactions and leading to harmful side-effects. Consequently, the geriatric population is at increased risk of falls, frailty, and dependence that enhances their susceptibility to morbidity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 respiratory syndrome, particularly interstitial pneumonia. The major challenge resides in the detection of infection that may present as atypical manifestations in this age group. Healthy aging can be possible with adequate preventive measures and appropriate medication regimen and follow-up. Adherence to the guidelines and recommendations of WHO, CDC, and other national/regional/international agencies can reduce the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Better training programs are needed to enhance the skill of health care professionals and patient\u2019s caregivers. This review explains the public health implications associated with polypharmacy on the geriatric population with pre-existing co-morbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These ethical concerns are in some way connected to the features of SPHM apps. From a literature survey, this paper attempts to recognize ethical issues with personal health monitoring apps on smartphones, viewed in light of general ethics of ubiquitous computing. The paper argues that there are ethical concerns with the use of SPHM apps regardless of the benefits that the technology offers to users due to SPHM apps\u2019 ubiquity leaving them open to known and emerging ethical concerns.

Previous studies have described atypical patterns of decreased short range and increased long range connectivity in ASD [1]. However, it remains unclear whether group level features of circuit dysfunction are consistently present across the range of cognitive function seen in the autism spectrum. \u2022 The dynamics of neural oscillations in the alpha range (6-12 Hz) are exquisitely sensitive to healthy development of functional and structural connectivity. Alpha-band coherence, measured with high temporalprecision electroencephalography (EEG) therefore represents an ideal tool for studying neural connectivity in developmental populations. \u2022 Here we examined spontaneous alpha phase coherence in a heterogeneous sample of 59 children with ASD and 39 age matched typically developing children. Using a data driven approach, we conducted an unbiased examination of all possible atypical connectivity patterns across all cortical regions. \u2022 Long-range hypoconnectivity was present in children with ASD compared to typically developing children, with temporal interhemispheric connectivity showing the largest difference between the two groups. \u2022 Decreased long range alpha coherence distinguishes a heterogeneous group of ASD children from typically developing children. Interhemispheric temporal hypoconnectivity represents a fundamental functional difference in children with ASD across a wide cognitive and age range that may reflect white matter disturbances or increased signal variability at temporal sites in ASD.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Vasospasm is the primary obstacle to widespread adoption of the radial artery as a conduit in coronary artery bypass grafting. We used optical coherence tomography, a catheter-based intravascular imaging modality, to measure the degree of radial artery spasm induced by means of harvest with electrocautery or a harmonic scalpel in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: Radial arteries were harvested from 44 consecutive patients with a harmonic scalpel (n \u00bc 15) or electrocautery (n \u00bc 29). Vessels were imaged before harvesting and after removal from the arm, with saphenous vein tracts serving as internal controls. Optical coherence tomographic findings for the degree of harvesting-induced injury were validated against histologic measures. Results: Optical coherence tomographic measures of endovascular dimensions and injury correlated strongly with histologic findings. Mean luminal volume, a measure of vasospasm, decreased significantly less after harvesting with a harmonic scalpel (9% AE 7%) than with electrocautery (35% AE 6%, P \u00bc .015). Completely intact intima was present in 11 (73%) of 15 radial arteries harvested with a harmonic scalpel (73%) compared with 9 of 29 arteries harvested by means of electrocautery (31%, P \u00bc .011). Intraoperative flow measurements and patency rates at 5 days postoperatively were not significantly different among groups. Conclusions: Optical coherence tomography provides a level of speed and accuracy for quantifying endothelial injury and vasospasm that has not been described for any other modality, suggesting potential as an intraoperative quality assurance tool. Our optical coherence tomographic findings suggest that the harmonic scalpel induces less spasm and intimal injury compared with electrocautery.",

        "abstract": "Typically, supply chain members are dependent on each other to manage various resources and information. The conflicting objectives and lack of coordination between supply chain members may often cause uncertainties in supply and demand. The basic elements of coordination theory like interdependency, coherency and mutuality may help in effective flow of information and material between the dependent supply chain members. Supply chain contract can be an effective coordination mechanism to motivate all the members to be a part of the entire supply chain. There are different types of supply chain contracts such as buy back and quantity flexibility contracts. Supply chain performance may be substantially improved by properly designing the contracts to share risks and rewards. The objective of this paper is to explore the applicability of coordination elements through an analytical model in three-level (Manufacturer-distributorretailer) serial supply chains using contracts. The model evaluates the impact of supply chain contracts on various performance measures. The impact of some contract may be on some specific performance measure only, which helps managers to choose the type of contract if there is an objective of improving certain performance measure before hand. In three-level supply chains, the contracts are designed at two distinct interfaces: Manufacturer-distributor and distributor-retailer. The model demonstrates the complexity in evaluating the decision variables of three level supply chains. The proposed model is a novel approach to apply coordination theory at various levels of supply chain. The model also presents how the coordination elements are related to each other in various coordination cases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Public trust in the authorities has been recognised in risk research as a crucial component of effective and efficient risk management. But in a pandemic, where the primary responsibility of risk management is not centralised within institutional actors but defused across society, trust can become a double-edged sword. Under these conditions, public trust based on a perception of government competence, care and openness may in fact lead people to underestimate risks and thus reduce their belief in the need to take individual action to control the risks. In this paper, we examine the interaction between trust in government, risk perceptions and public compliance in Singapore in the period between January and April 2020. Using social media tracking and online focus group discussions, we present a preliminary assessment of public responses to government risk communication and risk management measures. We highlight the unique deployment of risk communication in Singapore based on the narrative of \u2018defensive pessimism\u2019 to heighten rather than lower levels perceived risk. But the persistence of low public risk perceptions and concomitant low levels of compliance with government risk management measures bring to light the paradox of trust. This calls for further reflection on another dimension of trust which focuses on the role of the public; and further investigation into other social and cultural factors that may have stronger influence over individual belief in the need to take personal actions to control the risks.",

        "abstract": "Increased body mass index (BMI), as an approximation of body adiposity, is a risk factor for developing several adult malignancies. To quantify these risks, we reported a comprehensive systematic review (Lancet 2008; 371: 569-78) of prospective observational studies determining associations between BMI and risk of incident cancer for 20 cancer types. We demonstrated that associations are: (i) sex-specific; (ii) exist for a wider range of malignancies than previously thought; and (iii) are broadly consistent across geographic populations. In the present paper, we tested these data against the Bradford-Hill criteria of causal association, and argue that the available data support strength of association, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence and probably analogy. However, the experimental evidence supporting reversibility is currently lacking, though indirect evidence from longitudinal data in cohort studies and long-term follow-up post-bariatric surgery is emerging. We additionally assessed these data against appropriate adjustment for available confounding factors; measurement error and study design; and residual confounding; and found lack of alternative explanations. We conclude that there is considerable evidence to support a causal association between BMI and risk for many cancer types, but in order to establish the role of weight control in cancer prevention, there is a need to develop trial frameworks in which to better test reversibility. A Strong Association is More Likely to have a Causal Component than is a Modest Association Hill [4] illustrated this point with the high risk ratios for the association between exposure levels of smoking and incidence of lung cancer. However, he equally demonstrated with two counter-examples that the absence of a strong association does not rule out a causal effect and recognised that the impression of strength of association depended on the index used for the magnitude of association. For our systematic review, the index was BMI as an approximation of body adiposity. As BMI represents a spectrum of exposures (rather than a binary exposure), the size of the risk estimate is expressed relative to a given change in BMI. Accordingly, we chose 5 kg/m 2 increments (Table 1), such that increases in BMI of 5, 10 and 15 kg/m 2 are broadly equivalent to World Health Organisation [7] categories -source: https://doi.",

        "abstract": "New Zealand attracted much international attention in the late 1980s and 1990s for its radical economic and social reforms. This reforming tendency shows no signs of abating. In late 1999 the national (conservative) government was replaced by a Labour led coalition, which is rapidly and significantly changing the way publicly financed health services are organised. Before the general election, Labour had criticised the national government's quasimarket system for its narrow focus on the production of services rather than the improvement of health, for having fragmented a public service, for fostering inappropriate commercial behaviour, for increasing transaction costs, and for lacking local democratic input. These problems were attributed to the \"corporate model\" of public hospital provision and a single, national purchasing agency. Both will now be replaced with a system promoted as allowing greater community \"voice\" in health sector decision making and \"putting the public back into the public health system.\" This paper reviews New Zealand's experience with the quasimarket model and appraises the rationale for another round of structural change. We identify challenges policymakers face in achieving their goals, consider the general lessons provided by New Zealand's frequent U-turns in policy, and offer a set of criteria against which the new system might be assessed",

This work discusses the current status of the design, including a preliminary optical table layout, calibration options, error sources, and performance projections based on a CO2/CO laser system. In the current design, two-color interferometry is carried out at 10.59\u2009\u03bcm and 5.42\u2009\u03bcm and a separate polarimetry measurement of the plasma induced Faraday effect, utilizing the rotating wave technique, is made at 10.59\u2009\u03bcm. The inclusion of polarimetry provides an independent measure of the electron density and can also be used to correct the conventional two-color interferometer for fringe skips at all densities, up to and beyond the Greenwald limit. The system features five chords with independent first mirrors to reduce risks associated with deposition, erosion, etc., and a common first wall hole to minimize penetration sizes. Simulations of performance for a projected ITER baseline discharge show the diagnostic will function as well as, or better than, comparable existing systems for feedback density control. Calculations also show that finite temperature effects will be significant in ITER even for moderate temperature plasmas and can lead to a significant underestimate of electron density. A secondary role TIP will fulfill is that of a density fluctuation diagnostic; using a toroidal Alfv\u00e9n eigenmode as an example, simulations show TIP will be extremely robust in this capacity and potentially able to resolve coherent mode fluctuations with perturbed densities as low as \u03b4n\u2215n \u2248 10(-5).",

With intermittent or time-dependent exposures, lifetime risk is often approximated on the basis of a lifetime average daily dose (LADD). In this article, we show that there exists a lifetime equivalent constant dose (LECD) which leads to the same lifetime risk as the actual time-dependent exposure pattern. The ratio C = LECD/LADD then provides a measure of accuracy of risk estimates based on the LADD, as well as a basis for correcting such estimates. Theoretical results derived under the classical multistage model and the two-stage birth-death-mutation model suggest that the maximum value of C, which represents the factor by which the LADD may lead to underestimates of risk, will often lie in the range of 2- to 5-fold. The practical application of these results is illustrated in the case of astronauts subjected to relatively short-term exposure to volatile organics in a closed space station environment, and in the case of the ingestion of pesticide residues in food where consumption patterns vary with age.",

Although allowing emotion to overwhelm sensible analysis is both understandable and common among ordinary people, it is inappropriate for officials charged with keeping them safe. To do so is irresponsible, and it costs lives.Risk analysis is an aid to responsible decisionmaking that has been developed, codified, and applied over the past few decades \u2014 or in some respects centuries. We deal with four issues central to that approach and apply them to the hazard presented by terrorism: the cost per saved life, acceptable risk, cost-benefit analysis, and risk communication. We also assess the (very limited) degree to which risk analysis has been coherently applied to counterterrorism efforts by the U.S. government in making or evaluating decisions that have cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.At present, the process encourages decisionmaking that is exceptionally risk averse. In addition, decisionmakers appear to be overly fearful about negative reactions to any relaxations of security measures that fail to be cost-effective and also about the consequences of failing to overreact.If other uses of the funds available would more effectively save lives, a government obliged to allocate money in a manner that best benefits public safety must explain why spending billions of dollars on security measures with very little proven benefit is something other than a reckless waste of resources.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The secure working model classification of adult attachment, as derived from Main and Goldwyn's (in press) Adult Attachment Interview scoring system, was considered in terms of earned-security and continuous-security. Earned-security was a classification given to adults who described difficult, early relationships with parents, but who also had current secure working models as indicated by high coherency scores; continuous-security referred to a classification in which individuals described secure early attachment relationship with parents and current secure working models. Working models of attachment were classified as earned-secure, continuous-secure, or insecure in a sample of 40 parents of preschool children. Comparisons among the classifications were conducted on a measure of depressive symptoms and two sets of ratings of observed parenting styles. Adults with earned-secure classifications had comparable depressive symptomatology to insecures, with 30% of the insecures, 40% of the earned-secures, and only 10% of the continuous-secures having scores exceeding the clinical cut-off. The rate of depressive symptomatology in the earned-secure group suggests that reconstructions of past difficulties may remain emotional liabilities despite a current secure working model. With regard to parenting styles with their preschoolers, the behavior of earned-secure parents was comparable to that of the continuous-secures. This refinement in conceptualizing secure working models suggests ways for understanding variation in pathways to competent parenting as well as a possible perspective on how adults' adverse early experiences may continue to place them and their children at risk.",

The decision of military regimes to relinquish power from a position of strength and move towards democracy is conditioned by a number of factors, requiring the leader to navigate between the perceived need to maintain political order and military professionalism. This paper considers regime change in Ecuador and Niger as cases of conversion, where elites were able to maintain control in the face of relatively weak organised opposition. The aims of the paper are to (1) determine the factors that can initiate democratisation of military regimes and (2) identify the role of leaders in shaping the process. It is argued that the relative durability of the subsequent regime is determined by the ability of the outgoing military regime to find suitable opposition to maintain order and resist the temptation to return to politics",

The first\ndimension covers liability liquidity risk (or funding liquidity) modeling, the\nsecond dimension focuses on asset liquidity risk (or market liquidity)\nmodeling, and the third dimension considers asset-liability liquidity risk\nmanagement (or asset-liability matching). The purpose of this research is to\npropose a methodological and practical framework in order to perform liquidity\nstress testing programs, which comply with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019)\nand are useful for fund managers. The review of the academic literature and\nprofessional research studies shows that there is a lack of standardized and\nanalytical models. The aim of this research project is then to fill the gap\nwith the goal to develop mathematical and statistical approaches, and provide\nappropriate answers.\n  In this first part that focuses on liability liquidity risk modeling, we\npropose several statistical models for estimating redemption shocks. The\nhistorical approach must be complemented by an analytical approach based on\nzero-inflated models if we want to understand the true parameters that\ninfluence the redemption shocks. Moreover, we must also distinguish aggregate\npopulation models and individual-based models if we want to develop behavioral\napproaches. Once these different statistical models are calibrated, the second\nbig issue is the risk measure to assess normal and stressed redemption shocks.\nFinally, the last issue is to develop a factor model that can translate stress\nscenarios on market risk factors into stress scenarios on fund liabilities.",

It offers a contemporary and critical review of research in this area, and discusses a range of recent findings relating to a range of health issues including HIV and AIDS. Whilst the concept has a resonance for gay men and lesbians, and is widely used in 'lesbian and gay-affirmative' interventions, the paper demonstrates that research findings have been equivocal and the term is often used without full consideration of its sociopolitical consequences. The paper concludes that the concept does have a valuable role to play in health promotion work with lesbians and gay men but invites further discussion and examination of the construct.",

        "abstract": "Previous work has indicated that low temporal coherence of ultradian sleep electroencephalographic rhythms is characteristic of depressed patients and of depressed women, in particular. It may also be evident in one quarter of those at high risk, based on a family history of depression. Methods: The present study evaluated temporal coherence of sleep electroencephalographic rhythms in 41 adolescent girls with a maternal history of depression (high risk) and 40 healthy controls (low risk). The entire sample was followed clinically every 6 months for 2 years. Results: Temporal coherence was significantly lower among the high-risk girls than in controls. Regression analyses predicted group from coherence values and correctly classified 70% of the high-risk group with a false-positive rate of 5% among controls. Moreover, 54% of the high-risk girls were identified with extreme low coherence. On clinical follow up, 14 girls showed depressive symptoms, 9 in the high-risk group (22.5%) and 5 controls (12.2%). Six met DSM-IV criteria for firstepisode major depressive disorder, five high-risk and one control. Most importantly, 41% of those identified as having the most abnormal coherence values either showed symptoms of depression or met diagnostic criteria upon follow up. Conclusions: Low temporal coherence is evident in adolescent girls at high risk for depression. The more abnormal the coherence, the greater the risk of a first episode of major depressive disorder within 2 years of sleep study, approximately 10 times greater than in controls.

The FD-OCT catheter (DragonflyTM; St Jude Medical) employs a single-mode optical fibre, enclosed in a hollow metal torque wire that rotates at a speed of 100 r.p.s. It is compatible with a conventional 0.014\u2033 angioplasty guide wire, inserted into a short monorail lumen at the tip. The frequency domain optical coherence tomography lateral resolution is improved in comparison with TD-OCT, while the axial resolution did not change. These features, together with reduced motion artefacts and an increased maximum field of view up to 11 mm, have significantly improved both the quality and ease of use of OCT in the catheterization laboratory.3,4 However, the imaging depth of the FD-OCT is still limited to 0.5\u20132.0 mm.5\n\nThe main obstacle to the adoption of TD-OCT imaging in clinical practice is that OCT cannot image through a blood field, and therefore requires clearing or flushing of blood from the lumen.1 The 6 Fr compatible DragonflyTM FD-OCT catheter is so far the only one in the market, as two other systems from Volcano and Terumo, which \u2026",

The problem of risk evaluation of multivariate risk sources has been studied, and a multivariate risk measure, so-called multivariate average-value-at-risk, , is proposed to quantify the total risk. It is shown that the proposed operator satisfies the four axioms of a coherent risk measure while reducing to one variable average-value-at-risk, , in case N\u2009=\u20091. In that respect, it is shown that is the natural extension of to N-dimensional case maintaining its axiomatic properties. We further show is flexible by giving the investor the option to choose the risk level of each random loss i differently. This flexibility is novel and can not be achieved applying univariate with corresponding risk level \u03b1 to the sum of the risk marginals. The framework is applicable for Gaussian mixture models with dependent risk factors that are naturally used in financial and actuarial modelling. A multivariate tail variance and its connection with is also presented via Chebyshev inequality for tail events. Examples with numerical simulations are also illustrated throughout.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The study is based on new evidence drawn from five case study organisations in which a range of managers was interviewed in depth.   Findings \u2013 Analysis identifies a continuum of strategies from integration into the main workforce through to \u201cdeepened differentiation\u201d. Although integration is somewhat problematic when applied to a diverse group, differentiation seems predicated on a defensive, risk management approach designed to further marginalise this activity. Also, differentiation fails to address the aspirations of many employees, creating tensions between institutional strategy and the needs of academic heads.   Research limitations/implications \u2013 The number of case studies is limited. These case studies were selected because they had the most proactive strategies on this issue, which infers that the majority of employers in HE have not been rather less strategic or proactive.   Practical implications \u2013 The paper is of particular value to HR professionals considering the use of numerical flexibility approaches. It also contributes to the academic debate on the strategic value of such approaches.   Originality/value \u2013 The paper explores a neglected but important area of the workforce. The paper notes that some supposed benefits of numerical flexibility might be illusory, such as the deployment of allegedly \u201ccheap and disposable\u201d substitute workers which may be offset by unintentional consequences including rigidities in an organisation's human resource systems",

        "abstract": "Aim/Purpose: This paper presents a quantitative investigation of the organizational factors predicting the attrition of doctoral students' experience of meaning and how meaningful experience and meaningless work affect doctoral students' mental health and achievements. Background: Today's academic environment subsumes neoliberal principles of individualism, instrumentality, and competition. Such an environment can harm doctoral students' meaningful experience. Universities' market-driven practices, indeed, can lower doctoral students' motivation and affect their mental health. Methodology: In this paper, we referred to empirical knowledge to identify the ways through which today's academia erodes doctoral students' meaningful experiences. We hypothesized that environmental sources of meaning (e.g., coherence, significance, purpose, and belonging) become subsumed under neoliberal principles of individualism, instrumentality, and competition. Lower levels of sources of meaning directly predict the experience of meaningless work, which is linked to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and intention to quit among doctoral students. We conducted a cross-sectional study on a sample of N = 204 doctoral students who volunteered to participate by completing a survey with self-reported measures. We analyzed data collected via structural equation modelling to test the associations among the variables. Contribution: The present paper represents one an attempt attempts to investigate doctoral students' experience as subsumed to market-driven principles of the neoliberal ideology. Findings: Results of structural equation modelling show that higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms and intention to quit are associated with the lack of external supporting factors (i.e., PhD support), the perception of broad-based managerial practices as meaningless and instrumental, and a general sense of emptiness at work (i.e., meaningless work). Ultimately, doctoral students may strive to have a meaningful experience in today's academic environment. The experience of meaningless work leads to the risk of mental illness symptoms and quitting intention. Recommendations for Practitioners: This study suggests to practitioners to improve doctoral students' well-being with multilevel interventions approach as well as including academic stakeholders to have broader practical implications. Recommendation for Researchers: For researchers, it is suggested to focus on the managerial and organizational conditions of the academic environment that influence the basis of doctoral students' experience of doing a PhD. Impact on Society: This study affords society the importance of prioritizing the academic environment by looking at the meaning in work through the intersection of meaningful experience and meaningless work for doctoral students' mental health and achievement. Future Research: Future research can consider the role of factors contributing to doctoral students' meaningful experience by probing doctoral programs to understand students' mental health and achievement.",

The aim of the study was to measure the relative weighting of different types of risk information under various circumstances. The effect of presenting questions, and of explicitly formulating RRR, was analyzed. A preference for increases in RRR was demonstrated. There was a stronger inclination to choose the intervention that offered the highest RRR if RRR was explicitly stated. Individuals with more than 10 years of schooling also demonstrated a preference for increased ARR, but only when facing individually framed choices. In a social choice context, preferences for RRR remained intact, but the magnitude of ARR had no impact on choices. Results imply that social framing may induce a propensity to prefer interventions that target high\u2010risk populations. Those respondents who had received \u226410 years of schooling demonstrated preferences for RRR but not ARR, and no impact of social framing was observed.",

        "abstract": "The ability to share social network data at the level of individual\nconnections is beneficial to science: not only for reproducing results, but\nalso for researchers who may wish to use it for purposes not foreseen by the\ndata releaser. Sharing such data, however, can lead to serious privacy issues,\nbecause individuals could be re-identified, not only based on possible nodes'\nattributes, but also from the structure of the network around them. The risk\nassociated with re-identification can be measured and it is more serious in\nsome networks than in others. Various optimization algorithms have been\nproposed to anonymize the network while keeping the number of changes minimal.\nHowever, existing algorithms do not provide guarantees on where the changes\nwill be made, making it difficult to quantify their effect on various measures.\nUsing network models and real data, we show that the average degree of networks\nis a crucial parameter for the severity of re-identification risk from nodes'\nneighborhoods. Dense networks are more at risk, and, apart from a small band of\naverage degree values, either almost all nodes are re-identifiable or they are\nall safe. Our results allow researchers to assess the privacy risk based on a\nsmall number of network statistics which are available even before the data is\ncollected. As a rule-of-thumb, the privacy risks are high if the average degree\nis above 10. Guided by these results we propose a simple method based on edge\nsampling to mitigate the re-identification risk of nodes. Our method can be\nimplemented already at the data collection phase. Its effect on various network\nmeasures can be estimated and corrected using sampling theory. These properties\nare in contrast with previous methods arbitrarily biasing the data. In this\nsense, our work could help in sharing network data in a statistically tractable\nway.",

In the light of a number of years of PCD reviews and institutional reforms at both EU and member state level, this paper reflects on the dynamics of the PCD policy environment and discusses five challenges for the PCD policy agenda. These include the opposing interests of domestic and development constituencies, conflicts between development objectives themselves, disagreements between experts on what \u2018good\u2019 development policy is, difficulties in identifying the true development interest of developing countries, and the growing heterogeneity between and within developing countries. While the challenges discussed in this paper have general relevance, we draw on EU and Irish policies to illustrate the arguments. We conclude with a series of recommendations on how these challenges might be addressed and how to make the PCD agenda more effective.Policy Coherence for Development, European Trade and Agriculture Policy, Development Policy, Millennium Development Goals",

It is often the case that a series of signicant negative returns trigger a credit event such as a downgrade in rating, or even a default of the portfolio owner. We focus our attention on a Weighted Average of Ordered Returns, which is a statistic that allows us to weight returns according to their relative adverse impact. We use an option pricing approach to derive the theoretical price and properties of a forward, a swap contract, a call and a put option written on the Weighted Average of Ordered Returns under dierent assumptions about the distribution of returns. The models of returns considered in this paper are dened by the following underlying price processes: geometric Brownian motion, Merton model with Poisson jumps, and GARCH model. We present a convergence result which states that the price of a forward on the Weighted Average of Ordered Returns converges to the theoretical law invariant coherent risk measure. Finally, we show that the forward price process itself satises the axioms of a dynamic coherent risk measures.",

This poses a fundamental problem, because solutions that are\nnot stable under sample fluctuations may look optimal for a given sample, but\nare, in effect, very far from optimal with respect to the average risk. In this\npaper, we approach the problem from the point of view of statistical learning\ntheory. The occurrence of the instability is intimately related to over-fitting\nwhich can be avoided using known regularization methods. We show how\nregularized portfolio optimization with the expected shortfall as a risk\nmeasure is related to support vector regression. The budget constraint dictates\na modification. We present the resulting optimization problem and discuss the\nsolution. The L2 norm of the weight vector is used as a regularizer, which\ncorresponds to a diversification \"pressure\". This means that diversification,\nbesides counteracting downward fluctuations in some assets by upward\nfluctuations in others, is also crucial because it improves the stability of\nthe solution. The approach we provide here allows for the simultaneous\ntreatment of optimization and diversification in one framework that enables the\ninvestor to trade-off between the two, depending on the size of the available\ndata set.",
